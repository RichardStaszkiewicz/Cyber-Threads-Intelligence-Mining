Vehicle thieves in Kenya used jammers to steal vehicles. As drivers parked and presumably locked their vehicles with key fobs, thieves jammed the signal, and though the car's alarm made its usual sound, the car did not lock. The police claimed that the thieves also often disabled the carâ€™s GPS trackers with jammers that were purchased online.
