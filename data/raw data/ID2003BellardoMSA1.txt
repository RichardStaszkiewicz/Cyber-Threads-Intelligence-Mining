Monitoring WLAN communication. Monitoring network activity and matching source and target MAC addresses against an attack list. Identification of Denial-of-Service-Vulnerabilities in the 802.11 Protocol. Deauthentication attack to prevent authentication that is necessary when connecting to an access point by spoofing an authentication message by the attacker.   Deauthentication Attack: Monitoring network activity and matching source and target MAC addresses against an attack list. When a data or connection frame is received from a target, a Deauthentication Frame is spoofed. Spoofing of nodes and other MAC layer services possible. Spoofing of the Deauthentication message possible -> DoS attack on client possible. Spoofing of the Association Message. Spoofing of Polling messages. Spoofing of TIM Embassies. Clients can be erroneously awakened and put to sleep. Monopolize entire channels by sending short messages at the end of the interframe space interval. Valid clients can be prevented from gaining access to the channel by placing a large data field on the channel during the connection handshake. Blocking communication channel with Virtual Carrier Sense Attack for sending messages that contain a high value in the duration field of the message. Virtual carrier sense attack: Generation of packet streams with a large bandwidth of duration values. Spoofing of nodes and other MAC layer services possible. Spoofing of the Deauthentication message possible -> DoS attack on client possible. Spoofing of the Association Message. Spoofing of Polling messages. Spoofing of TIM Embassies. Clients can be erroneously awakened and put to sleep. Monopolize entire channels by sending short messages at the end of the interframe space interval. Valid clients can be prevented from gaining access to the channel by placing a large data field on the channel during the connection handshake.
