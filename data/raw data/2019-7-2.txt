A researcher has earned $10,000 from Tesla after discovering a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could have been exploited to obtain and possibly modify vehicle information. He was able to expose some internal Tesla application data. The exposed information included the vehicleâ€™s VIN, speed, temperature, version number, whether it was locked or not, tire pressure, and alerts. The data also included firmware details, geofense locations, CAN viewers, and configurations.
