Researchers looked into how Log4j vulnerabilities affected devices or properties embedded in or used for connected cars, chargers, infotainment systems, and digital remotes. In their research, they found that car chargers were at risk, including vehicle-to-grid ( V2G) systems in Europe. The V2G system allows stored energy in car batteries to be redistributed over the grid to help balance demand vis-à-vis production level. In addition, they found that A car’s IVI system, which uses a complex OS, could also be compromised. The researchers showed that by exploiting Log4j vulnerabilities, they could execute attacks on the vehicles and on their connected infrastructure.
