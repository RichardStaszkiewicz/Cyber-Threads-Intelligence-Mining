Provisional figures from the National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council ( NPCC) show a 3.1% increase in vehicle crime between May 2021 and June 2021. A large part of this increase comes from keyless theft as intelligence suggests that organized crime groups use relay technology to receive the signal from a key inside a house and transfer it to a portable device, allowing them to unlock and drive the car.
