In an attempt to mimic a Heads Up Display (HUD) on a C6 Corvette, a hacker built a custom HUD that showed the vehicleâ€™s speed and RPM on a transparent display mounted on a dashboard. The hacker collected the RPM and the speed of the vehicle with a Bluetooth OBD-II reader and then transferred the details to a development board that recorded the vehicle data to a SD card and another MCU that ran the actual LED displayed in the HUD.
