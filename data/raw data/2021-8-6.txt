Tom Cruise’s luxury BMW X7, with thousands of pounds worth of luggage, was stolen after car thieves hacked the vehicle, using a scanner to clone the signal from the luxury car’s keyless ignition fob. The thieves were able to steal the vehicle in minutes by intercepting the fob signal after it was left outside the hotel.
