According to the Peel Region Commercial Auto Crime Bureau, crooks could steal a fob signal to get into one's car. Once they're in, they disable the alarm system. In some vehicles, that can be done with a screwdriver or a rod to deactivate the horn. After that, they plug into the vehicle's onboard diagnostic port under the steering column. Then, use software, which is available online, to program a blank fob to start your car. Unlike using a wireless relay attack, thieves use a device to scan the signal from your keyless fob sitting inside the house. The thieves create a cloned fob that lets them get in your car and start it.
