A new research paper showing a vulnerability with Bluetooth Low Energy ( BLE) was used to single out Tesla, potentially resulting in remotely unlocking vehicles. Tesla announced they conducted the worldâ€™s first link-layer relay attack on Bluetooth Low Energy ( BLE), the standard protocol used for sharing data between devices that companies have adopted for proximity authentication to unlock millions of vehicles, residential smart locks, commercial building access control systems, smartphones, smartwatches, laptops and more. As they wrote, this was a specific exploit related to BLE, and it affected virtually every device that uses the protocol. Still, the reason Tesla was being singled out was that they demonstrated the vulnerability of Tesla vehicles. An attacker can unlock, start, and drive a car in cars with automotive keyless entry. The NCC Group has confirmed and disclosed a successful exploit of this for Tesla Models 3 and Y, with over 2 million of which have been sold.
