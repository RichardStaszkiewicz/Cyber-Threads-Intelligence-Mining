After recovering from a cyber attack in the beginning of 2020, Toll Group systems were hit by a new ransomware attack. After detecting unusual activity on the companyâ€™s servers, the company shut down some IT systems as a precaution. In the attack, some online customer applications were taken offline, and Toll's staff had to rely on personal computers and devices, as they were unable to work from company PCs.
