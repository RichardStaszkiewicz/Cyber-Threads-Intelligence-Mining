In an analysis report, Tracker, a vehicle theft solutions company, revealed that there was a 93% annual increase in keyless car thefts in the UK. The report indicated that relay attacks accounted for 93% of recorded thefts in 2020, a 27% increase over the last 5 years. According to the Head of Police Liaison for Tracker, thieves used sophisticated equipment to exploit keyless technology by hijacking the car key’s signal, typically from the security of the owner’s home, and remotely fooled the system into unlocking the doors and starting the engine.
