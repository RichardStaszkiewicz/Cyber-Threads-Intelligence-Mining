A tech firm from Bulgaria is selling devices for car thieves which are strikingly similar to old Nintendo Game Boys consoles. The company’s SOS Key Tool is marketed as ‘the most advanced locksmith tool’ available. It is currently sold for £20,000, and unlike other popular devices, it doesn't require a relay from a nearby key fob to unlock vehicles. The gadget records the car’s data and acts as a responder which the vehicle recognizes as an authorized remote. The car will unlock and start as if the thief had a valid key fob. A tutorial video on YouTube shows how it can be used to unlock modern Kia, Hyundai, and Mitsubishi models within a minute.
