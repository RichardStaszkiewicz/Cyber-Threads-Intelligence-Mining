In an attempt to prevent Nissan Leaf's battery degradation, a hacker developed a CAN-bridge to hack the CAN-messages between battery management and vehicle to avoid degradation. Through hacking into the CAN-messages sent to the battery management system, the hacker was able to lower the charging speed and prevent the battery from heating, a primary cause of degradation. The hacker offered the CAN-bridge and its software for sale at 450 Euro.
