Incidents involving keyless starting fob systems have been rising in Canada as thieves use electronic devices to enter vehicles, start their engines and leave within minutes, leading to Ontario Provincial Police to issue a warning to vehicle owners. According to the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA), the vehicle and fob communicate using low-power radio signals that are only effective within approximately 36 inches of the car door or ignition start/stop button and some thieves have developed special equipment to amplify the communication signals. This tricks the car into thinking the fob is next to the car door or trunk, allowing the vehicle to be unlocked and started.
