Western Massachusetts police reported an increase in organized crime car thefts, where hackers have driven around neighborhoods and used devices to capture vehicle key fob signals, later returning with a copy of the unique frequency to unlock the cars and steal them. The police also warned owners of push-to-start vehicles (where radio transmission of the key fob also acts as the engine switch) of the potential of having their cars quietly and easily stolen as well.
