According to the police, in a 6 month period, the group scoped out and targeted cars to steal, obtained key code information for these vehicles from unlawful websites, and created keys that allowed them to breach and steal the vehicles. In addition, the Attorney General’s office added that once inside of the vehicle, the thieves allegedly reprogrammed the vehicle’s computer system to gain control of the vehicle, disable alarms, and start the engine. In a matter of minutes, the theft crew was able to steal a vehicle without drawing any attention. In addition, the theft crew reprogramed the vehicle to stop recognizing the true owners’ electronic keys.
