A hacker from Luxembourg attached an Arduino Nano 33 BLE unit to the steering wheel of his BMW M140I and the turn signal stalk. This allowed the inertial measurement units to sense their positions and send them over Bluetooth to an Arduino Uno Wi-Fi. The Arduino Uno Wi-Fi communicated over USB to a Raspberry Pi, which was connected to the carâ€™s stereo via Bluetooth to blare an alarm when the steering wheel was turned but the turn signal remained untouched.
