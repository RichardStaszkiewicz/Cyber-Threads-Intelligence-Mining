Researchers from McAfee were able to fool an autonomous vehicleâ€™s driver assist system by manipulation of the camera. The researchers placed a small piece of tape horizontally across a 35 mile-per-hour speed limit sign. The change caused the vehicle to read the limit as 85 miles per hour, and its cruise control system automatically accelerated. The tests involved a 2016 Model S and Model X that used camera systems supplied by Mobileye Inc.
