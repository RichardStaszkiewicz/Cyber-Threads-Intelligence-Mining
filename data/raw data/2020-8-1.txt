Hackers are selling a database with information of a million Moscow region drivers for $1,500. The information includes the full name of car owners, their phone numbers, the vehicleâ€™s VIN, the vehicle's registration date, brand, model, and production year. The information in the database is not up-to-date and only includes information from 2019 and earlier.
