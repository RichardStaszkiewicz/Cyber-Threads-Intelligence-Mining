Numerous Mazda drivers in and around Seattle, USA, discovered they could no longer change the radio station or use other functionalities after listening to the local NPR station KUOW. The issue affected owners of various Mazda vehicles with model years ranging from 2014 to 2017 that were tuned in to the station. A bug in the carâ€™s infotainment software crashed after trying to load an image file that was missing an extension, and the infotainment software could not decode it and had no process for handling it. The solution involves replacing the CMU, the hardware computer component of the infotainment system.
