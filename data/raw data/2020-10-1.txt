A Chinese researcher discovered that adversarial projected objects could fool the autonomous systems in Li Xiang One (a Chinese connected vehicle). The attack path was discovered last year by a group of Israeli researchers that fooled Tesla's autopilot with projected images. The researcher demonstrated that Li Xiang One recognized a projected picture of a car as an actual vehicle and a projected human figure as a human. It's very likely that other autonomous vehicles in the market are also vulnerable to this attack.
