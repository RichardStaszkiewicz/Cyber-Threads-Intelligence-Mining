Misleading detector by using adversarial examples. Generation of adversarial examples in order to attack stop sign recognition and face recognition. Misleading the detector of traffic sign and face recognition. Small pertubations could mislead the Detector. Successful attacks on Faster RCNN ( can be generalized to YOLO 9000). Successful attacks with large pertubations ( can be transferred to the real world). Simple defense mechanisms cannot detect adversarial attacks.
