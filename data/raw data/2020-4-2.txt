Researchers found a vulnerability in Volkswagen Polo’s infotainment software update process and were able to exploit it to hack the unit. They also discovered that the infotainment unit used third-party software libraries that had known security flaws. The researchers also analyzed Ford Focus and identified what is suspected to be a Wi-Fi password from Ford's manufacturing plant. Using basic equipment, the hackers were able to intercept the messages being sent from the (Ford) tyres' TPMS to the car’s brain. The researches also bought a second-hand infotainment unit and discovered the previous owner’s personal details.
