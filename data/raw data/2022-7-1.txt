Researchers discovered a key fob vulnerability affecting major Japanese OEMâ€™s car models from 2012 to 2022, which they named Rolling-PWN. The researchers worked under the assumption that modern vehicles are often equipped with remote keyless entry ( RKE) systems that allow vehicles to be unlocked or started remotely. Their research goal was to evaluate the resistance of a modern RKE system. Furthermore, although the research was primarily focused on Japanese OEM vehicles, the researchers discovered that the vulnerability also applied to other global OEMs. According to the researchers, a local dealer would have to recall a vehicle to fix the Rolling-PWN bug. In any case, OTA updates of the vulnerable firmware would be the recommended mitigation strategy.
