A group of researchers worked with more than 10 auto manufacturers and suppliers to assess the hardware and software of more than 40 ECUs in development. Within those, they found over 300 vulnerabilities. The researchers concluded that only 20% of the vulnerabilities found were related to hardware issues. They assigned each vulnerability with a risk score according to ISO/SAE DIS 21434 and found that all vulnerabilities assigned with a high-risk score were a result of a fault in the software or OS of the ECU, and not related to hardware bugs. The results highlight that the more complex an ECU is, the more vulnerabilities exist in it and the percentage of the high risk vulnerabilities rises.
