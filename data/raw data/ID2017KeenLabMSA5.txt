Firmware Extraction of the Infotainment ECU. Telematic-Firmware dump. Obtainment of Firmware. Reverse Engineering Firmware. Reverse Engineering of the telematics firmware ( NGTP, Next Generation Telematic Pattern). NGTP could be completely reverse engineered. Forcing GSM communication with Vehicle. Surpessing the TSP signal to make the vehicle serviced by attackers base station. TSP signal could be suppressed. Sending malicious messages via GSM. Sending arbitrary NGTP messages to the vehicle directly to trigger BMW Remote Services.
Sending NGTP messages to BMW vehicles to read out BMW Remote Service. Bypassing the signature of the telematics firmware and sending CAN messages by reverse engieering the telematics firmware. Exploiting memory corruption vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass signature protection and achieve remote code execution in the firmware. Remote Code Execution. Control over ECUs of buses like PT-CAN, K-CAN, ... Activation of different diagnostic services by getting remote control of the telematics. Remote control over telematics and the head unit allows sending valid diagnostic messages to other ECUs. Activation of different Diagnostic services.
