Nearly 6,300 cars were stolen in Toronto in 2021, a 12% YoY increase from 2020. It was further reported that thieves were using several methods to steal cars. Some use a relay attack to capture the electronic signature of the key fob inside the homeownerâ€™s house, then open the door of the car and use a diagnostic device to create a new key. With the Ford F150, thieves pull the door handle, and use a pair of vice grips to crank the lock open. Once inside, they hook a diagnostic device to create a new key fob. Car manufacturers, sources say, have seen large quantities of blank key fobs go missing, and these were sold to thieves on the dark web.
