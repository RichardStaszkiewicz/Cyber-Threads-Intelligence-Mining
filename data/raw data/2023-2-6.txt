US safety advocates argue that Hyundai and Kia's anti-theft upgrade patch released on February 14, aimed at fighting car theft incidents, is insufficient. They suggest that the patch, which prevents the engine from starting without the correct key, does not provide comprehensive protection. Additional anti-theft measures, such as alarms and tracking devices, should be standard on all models.
