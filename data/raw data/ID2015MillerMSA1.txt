Reverse engneering of the OMAP chip in the WLAN module. Information Gain of OMAP chip Functionality. Disassembling the firmware, especially the WifiSvc binary, to get the key calculation algorithm. Identification of the Key Calculation Algorithm. Brute Forcing WLAN Password. Password extraction via brute force possible ( not carried out). Reverse engneering of the OMAP chip in the WLAN module and brute forcing the WLAN password.  Reduction of the search room. Reduction of the search space because the password gets created with the information of the construction year and month.  Creating a password list will reduce the time for brute forcing the key. Password extraction via brute force possible ( not carried out).
