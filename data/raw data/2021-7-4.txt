English detectives suggested Land Rover owners take steps to secure their vehicles following a spike in thefts across South Yorkshire. Between the beginning of May and mid-July, 42 Land Rovers were reported as stolen across the region. The police claimed that keyless entry vehicles were the most popular with thieves and asked people to follow security advice to protect their cars.
