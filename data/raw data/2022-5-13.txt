Hackers discovered a new attack vector in a Chinese OEM vehicle, which allowed them to conduct unapproved software upgrades to their vehicles. Despite being outside of the approved update region, the systems can be accessed remotely via OTA updates or physically via the OBD port. In some models, the ability to upgrade these systems at the push of a button extended beyond simple features, such as engine power and safety features. Pirated installations raise concerns regarding malfunctions in-vehicle systems, including active safety systems.
