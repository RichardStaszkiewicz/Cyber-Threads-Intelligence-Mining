The police in Gurugram, India, reported that 4,118 vehicles were stolen in 2019, including several hundred Toyota Fortuner vehicles. Other vehicles targeted were Toyota Innova and Honda. The thieves used cheap devices purchased from China. That enabled them to bypass the engine control module, unlock the vehicle, force start the engine, and access the vehicle's computer. After stealing the vehicle, the thieves disabled its GPS service. They change the vehicle's number plate and issue a new registration certificate so that they won't be traced.
