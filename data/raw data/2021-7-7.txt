Voltlog, a hacker and blogger, hacked the CAN bus console of a Volkswagen Golf vehicle. Voltlog explained that CAN bus interface boards were not strong in terms of technical aspects and designed his own wireless CAN bus hacking and development module called the ESP32 CanLite. In addition, Voltlog added the ability to switch automotive accessories using the ST VN750PC, a nifty high-side driver in an SO-8 package with integrated safety provisions. The hack was published as open source and the files could be pulled from his GitHub repository.
