San Diego's city attorney filed a lawsuit against South Korean OEMs for allegedly not installing adequate anti-theft technology in their vehicles, contributing to an increase in car thefts. The lawsuit covers the period from 2011 to 2021. Additional U.S. cities have also filed lawsuits against Hyundai and Kia in response to social media videos that prompted car thefts. Hyundai and Kia denied the allegations and stated that free anti-theft software upgrades were provided to vehicle owners with affected models.
