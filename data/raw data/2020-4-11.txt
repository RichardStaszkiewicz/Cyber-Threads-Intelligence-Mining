A hacker modified his OBD dongle to expose the serial lines between its ELM327 OBD chip and its Bluetooth chip and used them to connect to an Arduino powering an information display on the vehicle's dashboard. The device displayed information of some of the ECU units installed in the vehicle, including the battery voltage, RPM, MAP, Spark advance, intake temperature, engine coolant temperature, and information from the throttle position sensor.
