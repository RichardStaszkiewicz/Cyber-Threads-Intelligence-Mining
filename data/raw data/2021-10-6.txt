Hackers armed with a relay device struck in a Birmingham suburb by simply waving a bag near a house to unlock and start the vehicle outside. The October 13th CCTV footage showed a man holding a messenger-style bag up near the front of the home and front door until the white Kia Sportage opened and started. In less than 60 seconds, a relay device in the bag triggered and repeated the carâ€™s fob signal, allowing thieves to gain access and drive off.
