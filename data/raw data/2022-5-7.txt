The Insurance Crime Bureau has warned of an increase in car thefts by criminal syndicates using a method known as a relay attack. This device targets new-generation cars that have keyless entry and ignition technology. It’s different from the known signal-jamming device, which prevents the vehicle from locking so criminals can access it. The device gives criminals access to the car to copy the signal — meaning they can unlock and start the car and drive away. The device, examples of which police have confiscated, intercepts the signals sent by the key fob while looking for the linked car, allowing criminals to open it and steal the contents or even the vehicle itself.
