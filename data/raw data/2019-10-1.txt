Mobile app Mercedes-Benz car owners used to remotely locate, unlock, and start their cars displayed other people’s account and vehicle information. Mercedes-Benz’ connected car app pulled in information from other accounts, allowing users to see other car owners’ names, recent activity, phone numbers, and more. The app went offline “due to site maintenance” a few hours later.
