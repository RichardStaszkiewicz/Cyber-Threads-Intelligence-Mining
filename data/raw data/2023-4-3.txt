A vulnerability known as CVE-2023-29389, affecting Toyota RAV4 2021 was discovered by a security researcher. Toyota RAV4 2021 vehicles automatically trust messages from other ECUs on a CAN bus, which allows attackers sending forged "Key is validated" messages via CAN Injections, taking control of the vehicle and driving it away. The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the control CAN bus after pulling the bumper away and reaching the headlight connector.
