Researchers discovered an information disclosure and remote code execution vulnerability in a web server in some versions of the BlackBerry QNX software development platform. Blackberry's QNX is widely used in infotainment systems and digital instrument clusters, and the QNX SDP is aimed at supporting the development of connected car applications. The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from Blackberry's QNX SDP and run arbitrary executables with the web server's privileges.
