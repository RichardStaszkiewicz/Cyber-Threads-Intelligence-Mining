Misleading image classification network with non-targeted attack. Misleading the image classification network Clarifai.com. Non-targeted: Optimization-based -> many adversarial images could be transferred to other models. Fast Gradient -> High transferability. Real worls attack: Adversarial Examples for Clarifai. For non-targeted there is a high transferability, for targeted there is medium transferability ( 50-70%). Misleading image classification network with targeted attack. Targeted: Optimization-based -> hardly transferability possible. Fast Dradient -> Hardly transferability possible. Real worls attack: Adversarial Examples for Clarifai. For non-targeted there is a high transferability, for targeted there is medium transferability ( 50-70%).
