Simple Periodic Jamming Attack to disrupt the network. Conventional network traffic: email, web browsing, file transfer and telnet traffic. All nodes are static and transmitted with a power of 0.001 watts. All simulations have a runtime of 600 seconds. Execution of Simple Periodic Jamming Attack. The network nodes interpret the network as occupied and therefore cannot send any data.
