The insurance crime bureau warned of an increase in car thefts by criminal syndicates using a method known as relay attacks.  Relay attacks target new-generation cars that have keyless entry and ignition technology. The criminals intercept the signals sent by the key fob while looking for the linked car, which allows them to open the car and steal whatever is inside, or even the vehicle itself. The bureau said it had recently seen an increase in the theft of newer model sports utility vehicles ( SUVs) with keyless entry and ignition technology, with criminal syndicates using relay attacks to steal these vehicles.  In essence, a carâ€™s key fob is constantly transmitting signals looking for the linked vehicle.  The signal allows the driver to gain keyless entry and operate the car when the key is in close proximity to it.  By amplifying the signal, the perpetrators tap into the active emission of the key fob signal, allowing them to open and drive off with the vehicle. An individual possessing the amplifying device walked close to the unsuspecting owner when they exited and left the car.  At the same time, an accomplice at the vehicle gained access and drove off with it.  The bureau said that the best protection against relay attacks was to deactivate the key fob when exiting the car immediately and while still next to it.  Another option was to place the key fob in a signal blocking wallet or sheath.
