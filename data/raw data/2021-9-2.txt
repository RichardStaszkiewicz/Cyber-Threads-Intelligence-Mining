An East London gang used high-tech gadgets to steal 25 luxury cars which were then sold with cloned plates or dismantled for parts. The group of six men were all accused of being involved in the thefts, targeting expensive cars including an Audi S4, Land Rover Discovery, and a BMW X6. Some of the thieves used blank fobs to connect to the car's central computer and reprogram it as a new key.
