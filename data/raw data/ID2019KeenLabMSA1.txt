Two security vulnerabilities found in a Tesla's Model X and Model S Wi-Fi modules resulting in a buffer overflow attack. Reverse engineers commands from kernel to chip to reset and download new firmware. Debug, reset and download new Firmware. Overwrite interrupt controller code of the chip to shift memory each time an interrupt occurs. Heap overflow and DoS of firmware. Inject shell code into DMA buffer by using fake pointers. Code execution on wi-fi chip. Compromised chip sends tampered command id with shell code and points to stack of Linux host system. Stack overflow, shell code execution or DoS on Linux host system. Injected shell code tampers with iptables and enables telnet port 23. Remote telnet access to port 23 of Linux.
