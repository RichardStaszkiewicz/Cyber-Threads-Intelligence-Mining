Thieves in Canada used AirTags to locate and steal luxury cars. According to the York Regional Police Department, officers have investigated five incidents involving AirTags being used to steal luxury cars. The AirTags were reportedly placed in out-of-sight areas of the target vehicles when they were parked in public places. The vehicles were then tracked to the victim’s residence, where they were stolen from the driveway. The thieves’ modus operandi involved using tools like screwdrivers to enter the vehicles through the driver or passenger door, while ensuring not to set off alarms. Once inside, an electronic device, typically used by mechanics to reprogram the factory setting, was connected to the onboard diagnostics port ( OBD port) below the dashboard, where the thieves reprogrammed the vehicle to accept a key the thieves had brought with them. Once the new key was programmed, the vehicles started and were driven away.
