The city of Milwaukee, U.S., filed a lawsuit against South Korean OEMs over a spike in vehicle theft, particularly 2011-12 Kias and 2015-21 Hyundais with physical keys, which can easily be hacked using common tools as they lack immobilizers that require a key fob with a transponder. In February 2023, Kia and Hyundai announced the rollout of anti-theft software upgrades for the affected models after several other U.S. cities expressed concern over the issue.
