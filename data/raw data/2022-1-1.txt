Experts urged motorists to keep their keys in empty drinks cans or even the microwave after a locked BMW was stolen without obtaining the key. According to the police, thieves were able to gain access to vehicles by redirecting the wireless signal from a carâ€™s key fob. The police added that motor vehicles were extremely expensive, and as such owners should take the same precautions as they do with home security and suggested motorists use a blocking pouch also called a Faraday pouch, which is lined with metallic material, to help block the wireless signal from your key fob.
