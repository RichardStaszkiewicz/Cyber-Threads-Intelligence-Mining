Police appealed for information following several thefts of cars in the Macclesfield area in mid-March 2022. The officers received five reports of keyless Range Rover thefts in the Alderley Edge and Wilmslow areas. Two of the vehicles have since been recovered in the Greater Manchester area. According to the police, in the series of thefts, it was confirmed that most of the vehicles were stolen without the need for a physical key, commonly referred to as keyless thefts or relay thefts, where offenders can use devices that copy the signal of the typical key to gain access to the vehicle and start the ignition.
