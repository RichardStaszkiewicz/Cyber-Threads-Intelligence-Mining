The City of Rochester, New York, is planning to sue Kia and Hyundai for not including anti-theft technology in some of their vehicles. Rochester police stated that almost 75% of the vehicles stolen in the city since the beginning of 2023 were from these OEMs, which are more vulnerable to theft because of a lack of engine immobilizers. Rochester, along with other cities, will be seeking damages from Kia and Hyundai for the cost of the city's resources in response to these thefts.
