Tracker, a vehicle tracking company, noticed that more than 30% of all stolen vehicles it had recovered in March were Range Rovers. Police said that a relay attack method was used to steal more than 70 valuable Range Rovers, which were then sold on to unsuspecting customers. Tracker put the spotlight on thieves targeting Range Rover over and above any other make of vehicle.
