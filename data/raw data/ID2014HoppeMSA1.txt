Firmware Extraction. Getting navigation ECU firmware by Manufacturer ( CD or ISO image) and Reverse Engineering of the firmware. Information Gain of Firmware Functionality. Firmware Modification. Firmware modification ( including CRC adaption) and loading modified firmware on ECU. Firmware of the navigation device could be changed. Because of the connection of the navigation device to the infotainment CAN, manipulations via the CAN are possible. Flashing of modified firmware by reverse engineering and modification ( including the CRC checksum) of the ECUs firmware.
