Night surveillance video captured thieves from South St.Louis, Missouri hacking into a Chevrolet SUV in what appeared to be a keyless entry relay attack. At 3am, the hackers unlocked the victimâ€™s vehicle and stole possessions from inside. The theft was not an isolated incident; it was reported that several cars in the same area were hacked via a keyfob reader.
