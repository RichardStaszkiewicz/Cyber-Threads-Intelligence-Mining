As an experiment, a CEO of a Canadian-based company called Ingenext hacked an electric vehicle and removed its speed limitations. As a result, the vehicle reached a top speed of 216 mph. Ingenext's vehicle included bigger brakes and higher performance tires, the modifications were done mostly for safety reasons. Accordingly, a regular car might have burnt up its tires and wouldnâ€™t be able to perform a safe halt if it had reached such high speeds.
