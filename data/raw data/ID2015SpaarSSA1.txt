Extraction of hard coded keys by dumping and reverse enginering the remote gateway firmware. Access to the Combox, desoldering the Flash Chips of the Modem Module, coupling the chip to adapter board and STM32. Reading the firmware as assembler code and decoding the emergency SMS by using a hard-coded data block as a key. Identification of crypto and hash algorithms, used tables and constants from the firmware. ->  Encryption and signature over 16 pairs of two 64-bit keys. DES algorithm. Decoded Emergency SMS.
