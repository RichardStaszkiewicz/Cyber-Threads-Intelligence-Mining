A hacker named greenluigi1 bought a Hyundai loniq and demolished its Linux-based head unit firmware. He was able to bypass every authentication mechanism for firmware updates, reverse engineer the code, and create subversive update files that granted him access to the root shell of the head unit. The hacker reverse engineered the app framework to create his own app. Then, by connecting into the dashboard's APIs, he was able to monitor the car status and control the locking mechanism through his app.
