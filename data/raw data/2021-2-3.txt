Security researchers found that a security vulnerability known for decades to researchers could be used to manipulate IoT devices. The TCP communications-based vulnerabilities, used in the automotive industry, could allow cyber attackers to intercept and manipulate data of IoT and OT devices as patterns of Initial Sequence Numbers that are not generated randomly, making them predictable for a third party.
