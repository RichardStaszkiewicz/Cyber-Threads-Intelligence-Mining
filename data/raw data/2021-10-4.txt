Italian State police arrested a 54-year-old suspect for aggravated theft after preventing vehicles from locking after the drivers exited their cars. Immediately after drivers exited their vehicles, a signal jammer was used to prevent the carâ€™s locking mechanism from engaging.  As the owners walked away the thief had ample time to enter the vehicle and manipulate the ignition system.
