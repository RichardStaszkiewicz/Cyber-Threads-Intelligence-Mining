Three stolen Kias from one family in less than a week. The issue was with base model Kia and Hyundais that use a physical key to start the car. The cars are missing an anti-theft device so that they can be started without the key. In three weeks, there were just over 400 reported cars stolen in the city of Columbus. Of those, 45 reported stolen Kias, and 68 reported stolen Hyundais. Kia said they were fixing the issue with all new vehicles, but Columbus police said there is a way to protect your car from thieves.
