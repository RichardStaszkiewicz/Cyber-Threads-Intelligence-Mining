Three men were charged early October 2021 with using a Nintendo Game Boy to break into cars. According to West Yorkshire Police, the offenders used a handheld gizmo that looked like a Nintendo Game Boy to fool the car’s keyless entry and ignition that a legitimate keyless fob was being used. In addition, police say that from May through July of 2021, more than 30 Mitsubishi Outlanders were stolen, and that led to an investigation that ended up linking the three men to a conspiracy involving five separate vehicle thefts valued in excess of £180,000 ( over $330,000).
