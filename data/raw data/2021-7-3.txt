P1kachu, an automotive security specialist, hacked the engine control units ( ECUs) of the two old Honda cars in Japan. The hacker worked on both the 1996 Integra and the 1993 Civic, which have similar engines but different ECU hardware, tried to use the serial port on the back of the PROM copier, and brute-forced it. P1kachu revealed the ASCII pinout of the 27C256 EPROM, wired out an Arduino Mega and wired it up to the chip, and managed to hack and manipulate the car.
