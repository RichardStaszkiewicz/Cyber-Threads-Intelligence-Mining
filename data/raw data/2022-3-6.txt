Four Ram 1500s were recently stolen from the Sterling Heights Stellantis Assembly Plant in Michigan, one of them being a high-performance Ram 1500 TRX. The thieves relied on its high performance to smash through the front gate and make their escape, just one week after a similar incident involving the same vehicle model. These are in addition to five Ram trucks being stolen from a lot in Shelby Township, while three Dodge Charger Hellcat Widebody models were taken from a lot in Auburn Hills on March 3rd. The month before, a Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk and Dodge Challenger Hellcat were stolen from the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit.
