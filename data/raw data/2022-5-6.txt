Car thieves turned to a two-person system that, with the help of technology, allows them to pop the locks on cars with keyless entry and then, if the vehicle has a keyless start, drive off. A citizen of South Austin, Texas, said his neighborhood had been hit by thieves using what are known as relay devices to get into locked vehicles, with at least three people that were roaming around a particular street. Two cars were stolen in one night. The method the thieves used was that one would go to the front door of an unsuspecting house because many people store key fobs near the front door. They will capture and amplify the signal from the fob just inside the door. Meanwhile, the second thief will wait by the car, holding a second hacking device near the car door. The vehicle, engineered to do as the key fob says, opens the door, allowing the thieves to either take the carâ€™s content or, in some cases, the vehicle itself.
