Automated attacks influence robotic vehicles. Reverse engineer control algorithm of robotic vehicle to find detection threshold and monitoring window used by intrusion detection system. Obtain the detection threshold and monitoring window used in the IDS. Manipulate environment variable to inject malicious libraries instead of the originals. Stealthy attack by manipulating sensor measurement and actuator signals. Stealthy attack during switch mode by manipulating sensor measurement and actuator signals. Stealthy attack by injecting an artificial time delay. Service/Business disruption, Manipulate car systems of robotic vehicle, over a period of time, the attacker will be able to significantly deviate the robotic vehicle from its original mission path.
