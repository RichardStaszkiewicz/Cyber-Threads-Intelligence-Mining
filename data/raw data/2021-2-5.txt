Michigan police were looking for criminals using expensive technology to steal cars. An internal memo from the Michigan State Police said thieves were breaking into peopleâ€™s cars and using a special tablet to program a new key fob, meaning the original key would no longer work. The Michigan State Police bulletin said hundreds of Fiat-Chrysler vehicles have been stolen. Primarily the thieves were targeting 2014-2021 Dodge Challengers, Chargers, Durangos, and Jeep Grand Cherokees.
