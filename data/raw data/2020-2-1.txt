Security researchers at the Sky-Go team found 19 vulnerabilities in a Mercedes-Benz E-Class car, allowing them to open its doors remotely and start the engine. The researchers gained access to the car's backend servers by reverse-engineering the vehicle's embedded SIM card, which connects to the cellular network. They communicated with the Mercedes backend servers and spoofed legitimate requests of Mercedes App users correlated to a different car. For legal reasons, the research team only tested the vulnerabilities in China.
