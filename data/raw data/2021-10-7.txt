Car thieves in a Birmingham road hacked and stole a Mercedes C Class Coupe using a relay attack station, despite not having the keys. On October 19th, thieves were believed to have used a relay device to amplify the signal from the vehicleâ€™s fob and then unlocked the vehicle and drove off shortly after.
