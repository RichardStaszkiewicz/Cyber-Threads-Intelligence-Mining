Thames Valley Police urged citizens to keep their keyless fobs as far away as possible from their parked cars following a string of thefts across Berkshire where keyless cars have been stolen. One incident involved a keyless Range Rover Velar which was stolen without the key fob on site. The second vehicle was a keyless fob entry Land Rover which was tracked by the Land Rover tracking department who alerted the owner that it was driven without a fob inside the car, and believed it may have been stolen using a relay device.
