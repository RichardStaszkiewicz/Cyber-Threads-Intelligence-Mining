Detectives from South Yorkshire Police, UK urged drivers to keep an eye on their vans after a string of thefts over the last few months. The detectives explained that the thieves managed to open, start, and drive away in a van without needing the owner’s key. This was achieved by cloning the signal from the van’s remote key fob in a method known as a relay attack.
