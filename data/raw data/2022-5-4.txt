The keyless entry systems are easy to break due to vulnerabilities of the radio signals used to unlock the doors. Ford developed a solution to prevent the most common theft method, called the key fob relay attack. The keyless entry system, which added convenience to unlocking and starting a vehicle since there’s no need to use a physical key anymore, was vulnerable to attacks that led to many car thefts worldwide, as thieves had discovered that too soon stealing a car became very easy. Ford found a solution and filed a patent to protect it. Called system for preventing vehicle key fob relay attacks, the patent describes a new authentication system that allows the car to know whether the original key is near the vehicle or not. According to the patent filed on October 29, 2020, and published on May 5, 2022, the authentication system can obtain historical data, including the time and location of the key fob. Thus it can determine if the person trying to unlock the car is the owner or another person. For instance, since the car knows that the key moved away when the owner left the vehicle, it will not respond to a signal that suddenly appears in its vicinity. There is still a place for improvement, as the spoofing devices can emulate the key even in approaching the vehicle. Still, it’s progress in finding a solution to a significant attack method used by thieves, impacting the automotive industry. In addition, to avoid this kind of man-in-the-middle attack, it’s best to have a system that works at a very close distance. Newer vehicles use NFC to open and start, which is far more secure than a radio signal that can be sniffed further away.
