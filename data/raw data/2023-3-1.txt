Concerns are rising over the cybersecurity of EV charging infrastructure following research that identified vulnerabilities in the Open Charge Point Protocol ( OCPP). The vulnerabilities could allow hackers to carry out distributed denial-of-service attacks or steal sensitive information. In addition, outdated Linux versions, unnecessary services, and inadequate controls were identified in an Idaho National Laboratory survey. Experts claim that cybersecurity measures and a comprehensive charging infrastructure must be implemented. With many EV chargers considered an IOT technology, ensuring encrypted communications is crucial to maintaining security. Experts suggest that the US government strengthen cybersecurity with standards and best practices. Several initiatives are recommended to strengthen cybersecurity, including improving EV owner authentication and authorization, adding more security to the cloud component of the charging infrastructure, and hardening the actual charging units against physical tampering.
