A team of Dutch forensic researchers reverse engineered a Teslaâ€™s vehicles data storage system. They discovered far more detailed data than expected, including speed, accelerator pedal position, steering wheel angle, and brake usage. The team assessed the data instead of requesting it from Tesla following a crash that occurred while Autopilot was active. The news of the hack could have implications for US investigators who are probing a dozen incidents of crashes involving Tesla vehicles and emergency vehicles while Autopilot was in use.
