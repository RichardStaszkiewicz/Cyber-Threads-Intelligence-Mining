On January 1st, 2022, Acura and Honda navigation system automatically changed to January 1st, 2002, with the time resetting to 12:00, 2:00, 4:00, or other times based on the model or possibly the region in which the car was located. This happened after Honda and Acura cars were hit with the Y2K22 bug that reset the navigation system's clock to January 1st, 2002, with no way to change it to the correct time. Honda and Acura car owners reported that the Y2K22 bug affected almost all older cars, including Honda Pilot, Odyssey, CRV, Ridgeline, Odyssey and Acura MDX, RDX, CSX, and TL models.
