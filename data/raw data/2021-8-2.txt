Researchers discovered numerous security flaws in a range of smart electric vehicle chargers, including devices by Wallbox and Project EV. The researchers were able to remotely switch the chargers on and off, remove the owner’s access, and lock or unlock the charging cable. They explained that one could take control of the Wallbox charger, gain full access, and remove the owner's access to the charger. Furthermore, they claimed it was possible to stop the chargers from charging their own vehicles, and use them to charge the attacker’s vehicle for free charging. One of the researchers added that changing the programming on the device would allow an attacker to permanently disable the charger or use it to attack other chargers or servers, and that bad actors could also infiltrate a home network in cases where the chargers were connected by Wi-Fi.
