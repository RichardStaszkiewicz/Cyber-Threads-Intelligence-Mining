Halton Regional Police warned residents in Burlington, Oakville and Milton to take steps to avoid having their car stolen. Thefts of vehicles, especially higher-end vehicles, were on the rise, with police reporting seven being stolen right from residential driveways during one overnight period. According to the police, as vehicles relied more on keyless entry and remote starters, blackmarket technology to counter that had made stealing cars quicker and easier.
