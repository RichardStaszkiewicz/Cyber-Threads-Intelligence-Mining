A Canadian company hacked Tesla’s software, and it is now offering some of its Tesla software performance upgrades at a discount. The company offers an easily pluggable connector that cracks Tesla's 'acceleration boost' which unlocks roughly 50 hp in the Model 3 powertrain and shortens the acceleration. The company also added an additional “drift mode” capability to those who purchase the “acceleration boost” package. The company also offers to upgrade Model 3 Dual Motor vehicles to a Model 3 Performance, however, this service is more invasive, requires professional hardware installation, and will disable the capability to receive software updates from Tesla.
