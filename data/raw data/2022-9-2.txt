Security researchers at IOActive reverse-engineered Teslaâ€™s NFC protocol and demonstrated a new relay attack. The attack enables Tesla vehicles to be stolen quickly, although the thieves need to work in pairs and be as close as two inches from the phone or key card. Security researchers believe that the hack can be achieved with longer distances between the device and the key using Bluetooth protocols.
