Six vehicles were stolen using relay and reprogramming technology, leading to a Brantford police investigation. The stolen vehicles were two Lexus RX5s, three Toyota 4Runners, and a Toyota Highlander. According to the police, the stolen vehicles were all new high-end models with keyless entry and push start technology. In addition, they explained that suspects use technology to find a key fob signal inside homes and use that technology to amplify and transfer the key fob signal to unlock, start and steal the vehicles. Furthermore, the police added that the suspects could also force entry inside a vehicle and use an electronic device to access diagnostics and they can reprogram a blank key fob to start the vehicle they plan to steal.
