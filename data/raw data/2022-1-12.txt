Polish developer Michał Gapiński shared a look at CarPlay running on his Tesla Model 3 contrary to the fact that Tesla doesn’t support CarPlay and writes its own software for its infotainment system. The ability to operate CarPlay came with limited functionality, including being run by an in-car Raspberry Pi running a custom build of Android OS. In addition, Gapiński had to use the Raspberry Pi’s mouse for navigation in place of the touchscreen.
