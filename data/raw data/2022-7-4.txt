A security researcher discovered a new kind of relay attack that works on cars like Tesla. The researcher exploited a vulnerability in keyless entry technology, specifically phone as a key, a method used by many companies, including Tesla. The researcher reported that he used a free software and off-the-shelf hardware to make a relaying device to break into the vehicle for as low as $10. Since two of these devices were needed, the total cost was $20.
