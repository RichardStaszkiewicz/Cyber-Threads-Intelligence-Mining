Brute force attack on security access lead to extraction of the key in 1.5 days. Physical access to ECU. Supply Voltage applied to ECU. CAN-to-USB-Converter and oscilloscope connected to ECU. Brute forcing the seeds from the security access by sending of CAN diagnostic messages with varrying seeds. During brute force: powercycling of the ECU to reduce the brute force time because of sending intervall. Key could be found in 1.5 days.
