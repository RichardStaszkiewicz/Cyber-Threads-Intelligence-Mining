Security research revealed vulnerabilities in the ALAC format of Qualcomm chipsets, which are also used in automotive infotainment systems. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, threat actors could remotely listen to audio conversations and view media on affected devices. The vulnerabilities were discovered by Check Point, and can be exploitable through remote code execution attacks on mobile devices. In addition, an unprivileged Android app could exploit the vulnerabilities to escalate its privileges and access user data.
