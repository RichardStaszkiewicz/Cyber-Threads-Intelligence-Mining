Ford and Fiat vehicles have been targeted in a spate of thefts, where burglars use cloned keyless fobs to break into cars and vans. Popular car models such as the Ford Fiesta and Focus were among the most stolen in the UK. According to Facebook page Stolen Vehicles East Yorkshire, there has been a startling increase in the numbers of these cars being stolen, as thieves were cloning car keys by plugging a device into OBD ports. Other reports have suggested that thieves were using sophisticated new tactics to gain entry to vehicles. Using keyless relay devices such as skeleton or Tibbie keys, they were said to be cloning wireless key signals, allowing them to open the cars on the driveway. Furthermore, in Staffordshire, Fiat 500 models and Ford Transit vans are being targeted with an increase in thefts in recent months to December 2021.
