A researcher discovered that Power Line Communications ( PLC ) signals could be easily read using active antennas placed between 6-8 feet away from the trailer. The cybersecurity impact of this vulnerability is heavily dependent on which information is sent by ECUs on the trailer PLC bus. Typical trailer traffic includes only ABS fault messages and will thus have minimal loss of confidentiality. However, the vulnerability can have a severe impact in cases where manufacturers leverage PLC for sensitive information such as air weight axles or key exchange in setting up high-speed wireless links in future tractor-trailer interfaces.
