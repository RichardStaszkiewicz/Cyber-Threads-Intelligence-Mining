The Nigerian Communications Commission ( NCC) warned of an ongoing cyber-vulnerability that allowed a nearby hacker to unlock vehicles, start their engines wirelessly and make away with cars. In a statement, the NCC said that the fact that car remotes were categorized short-range devices that make use of radio frequency ( RF) to lock and unlock cars informed the need for the Commission to alert the general public of this emergent danger, where hackers take advantage to unlock and start a compromised car. It was reported that the vulnerability was a Man-in-the-Middle ( MitM) attack or, more specifically, a replay attack in which an attacker intercepts the RF signals normally sent from a remote key fob to the car, manipulates these signals, and re-sends them later to unlock the car at will.
