Tesla Model 3 was hacked in under two minutes at the Pwn2Own annual hacking contest by a team of French security researchers. The security researchers demonstrated two separate exploits, including one that involved an attack on Tesla's Gateway energy management system, giving the researchers access to subsystems that control the vehicle's safety components. Another exploit involved breaking into Tesla's infotainment system through a Bluetooth chipset vulnerability, allowing the researchers to gain root access to other subsystems. Due to the risk of hacking an actual Tesla vehicle, the researchers demonstrated their exploits on an isolated vehicle head unit that controls the car's infotainment system and provides access to navigation and other features. The researchers were rewarded with $350,000 and a new Model 3 for their exploits.
