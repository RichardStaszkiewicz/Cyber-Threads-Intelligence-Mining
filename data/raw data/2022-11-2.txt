Security researchers found a vulnerability in SiriusXM, a 3rd party services-provider that powers telematics and infotainment systems for connected vehicles. OEMs typically use SiriusXM services to provide in-vehicle remote functionality. By sending API requests with the VIN on a unique ID field, the security researchers were able to access sensitive vehicle owners’ information, remotely locate vehicles, flash their lights, unlock doors and remotely start engines in in various Honda, Nissan, Acura and Infinity’s connected vehicles.
