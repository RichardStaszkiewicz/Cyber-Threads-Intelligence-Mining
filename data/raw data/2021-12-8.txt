A vulnerability ( CVE-2021-45046) was disclosed in Apache Log4j, a Java-based logging utility. When addressing the Log4Shell vulnerability ( CVE-2021-44228) in Apache Log4j, researchers found that the fix to the vulnerability was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map ( MDC) to insert data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup or a Thread Context Map pattern to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern. This can result in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments. In addition, potential attackers might exploit this vulnerability to gain better access to chargers and cars using the V2G stack in Java.
