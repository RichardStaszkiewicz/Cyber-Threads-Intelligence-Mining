Hackers were believed to have used relay devices to hack and steal BMWs and Mercedes vehicles during a spate of keyless car thefts across the UK’s Hampshire district. Local police stated that the hackers allegedly started the cars remotely via a relay device, which connected with the vehicle’s fob. Among the stolen cars were a BMW 320d SE, a BMW 520d M Sport, a Mercedes GLC 250, a Mercedes GLE 250 AMG, a Mercedes AMG E63, and a Mercedes GLC 250.
