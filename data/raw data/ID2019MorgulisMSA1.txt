Using adversarial examples ( traffic signs) to attack traffic sign recognition system in vehicle. Creating adversarial examples with extended DARTS approach from Sitawarin et al. Adversarial examples can be used to mislead traffic sign recognition. Misleading Traffic Recognition System by applying adversarial examples. Traffic Recognition could be fooled. Thus, speed limits were not recognized correctly. Traffic Recognition could be fooled up to 40 %. Thus, speed limits were not recognized correctly. In some cases, the attacks were not successful. However, there was a situation in which the traffic recognition did not work anymore ( Denial-of-Service).
