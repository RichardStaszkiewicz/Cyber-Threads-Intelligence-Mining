A researcher reverse engineered the memory, the graphic interface, and the firmware of an OBD-II reader and turned the device into a custom attack tool. The tool allowed attackers to upload payloads into the device, select them from a selection menu on the device's graphic interface, and run them on the vehicle. The researcher also demonstrated the ability to draw images on the screen of the device.
