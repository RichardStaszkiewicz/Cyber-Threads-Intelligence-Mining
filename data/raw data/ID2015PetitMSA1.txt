Relaying signals captured by a lidar and transmitted to the vehicle to falsify the echo. Influence of the driving behaviour by replay of the lidar signal possible. Relaying signals captured by a lidar and transmitted to the vehicle to fake echo lidar signals in order to disturb autonomous driving functions. Spoofing of fake echo lidar signals. The generation of fake objects is possible through the spoofing attack.
