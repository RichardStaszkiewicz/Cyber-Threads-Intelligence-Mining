A Dodge Charger was stolen in Detroit, MI, USA in November 2021 via a key fob attack. The thieves hacked the car ownerâ€™s key fob to get in, start the car, and drive away with the vehicle. According to the police, the hackers had a programmer which cost around $8,000. Upon recovering stolen vehicles, owners discovered that their key fobs no longer worked, as the hackers reproduced new key fobs, rendering previous keys unrecognizable to their vehicle. Just a week prior Detroit police found key fobs and a key fob programmer in a car during a traffic stop. It was further explained that the thieves only needed to be close to your key fob for the programmer to pick up and reproduce its signal.
