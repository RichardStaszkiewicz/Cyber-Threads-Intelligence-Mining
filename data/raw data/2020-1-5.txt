A backup MSSQL database of the German car rental company Buchbinder was found unsecured on the internet. The database stored ten terabytes of data and contained information of over 3.1 million customers of the company in Germany, Australia, Italy, Slovakia and Hungary. The breach exposed the personal information of customers like their address, phone numbers and license numbers. In addition, financial information included in the contracts was leaked as well. 170,000 of the records that got exposed included passwords for employees and online portal users, some of them stored unencrypted in plain text.
