Remote attack on the Tesla Autopilot. Get control of 3G/Wifi. Communication with Gateway. Exploit the WebKit browser by exploiting a vulnerability for arbitrary code execution. Writting arbitrary data to specific to memory adress and implementing a shell. Exploit the Kernel and Bypass AppArmor. Flashing Firmware. Get Root Shell of CID. Write arbitray data to arbitrary address. Controll of CID. Sending commands form CID to a TCP port of APE which accepts the commands install  and m3-factory-deploy without restrictions. Perform fake handshake and install commands. Get root shell of the Autopilot ECU ( APE) via ape-updater. With command m3-factory-deploy the path to the server which provides the firmware is changed. Afterwards the install command is used to install a codesegmenet through the ape-updater for Autopliot ECU ( APE). This leads to root priviledges and acceptance of Linux commands on APE.
