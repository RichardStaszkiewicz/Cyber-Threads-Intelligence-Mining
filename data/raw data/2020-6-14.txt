Researchers identified two vulnerabilities in MAVLink, a protocol designed for communication with unmanned vehicles. The first vulnerability is the protocol's lack of encryption, which allows a remote attacker who has access to the communication medium access to sensitive information by intercepting the unencrypted messages. The second vulnerability is that the protocol lacks an authentication system and is therefore vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including identity spoofing, unauthorized access, MITM attacks, and more.
