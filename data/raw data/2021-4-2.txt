Fairfax County Police say thieves hacked and stole three vehicles from driveways in an Alexandria, VA neighborhood in mid-April 2021. The thieves stole the vehicles by hacking signals from the keyless entry fobs that were inside the owner’s homes early in the morning. Video feeds showed the thieves hacking one family’s Black Audi Q7 and an Infiniti Fx35. The other theft was of a BMW car the same morning from a home nearby, using the same hacking method.
