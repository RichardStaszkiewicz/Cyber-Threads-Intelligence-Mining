An issue was discovered on Realtek RTL8195AM, RTL8711AM, RTL8711AF, and RTL8710AF devices. A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the client code that takes care of WPA2's 4-way-handshake via a malformed EAPOL-Key packet with a long keydata buffer. These devices are highly popular standalone, low-power-consumption WiFi hardware modules, used for embedded devices in several industries such as the agriculture, healthcare, and automotive sectors.
