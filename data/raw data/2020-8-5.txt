Hackers offered to sell VPN access to a major automotive manufacturer in South Korea. The hackers were affiliated with the profitable hacking group FXMSP and presumably gained network access by exploiting a Pulse VPN vulnerability (CVE-2019-11510) and sustained access after the patch was applied. A researcher who contacted one of the hackers identified Hyundai as the victim of the attack and received a screenshot with Hyundaiâ€™s host names as a proof of access to their network.
