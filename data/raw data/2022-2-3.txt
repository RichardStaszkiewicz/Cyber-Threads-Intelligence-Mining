Criminals have been exploiting technology to get into cars and drive them away without using a physical key fob in Cheshire, UK. The local police claimed that keyless car theft, or relay theft, a method in which a device is used to manipulate a car into thinking the key is close by has seen a spike in use. According to the police, the thieves needed to be within a few meters of your car key to capture the signal, even if it’s inside the driver’s house, meaning that even if the vehicle and home are secure, thieves can still unlock, start and steal your car. As such, in light of a rise in Range Rover vehicles thefts in Cheshire, the local police have issued the following safety tips to help drivers protect their vehicles.
