The Ottawa Police Service ( OPS) warned residents about an increase in car thefts where the suspects mainly targeted newer models of the Honda CRV. There have been 21 Honda CRVs stolen in two weeks. The police service noted a shift in trends regarding vehicle thefts and saw a sudden spike in CRV thefts from owner driveways and more vehicles taken from car dealerships outside their hours of operation. The OPS added that over 230 cars were reported stolen by the end of May 2022, compared to half during the same time frame in 2021. The OPS said vehicle thefts usually happened in one of two ways: The driver-side door was mechanically breached, at which point thieves accessed the vehicleâ€™s engine control module ( ECM) port to reprogram a new key. This was the most common type of vehicle theft, and it is not deterred by using a radio frequency shield ( known as a faraday bag or box.) The signal amplification relay attack ( SARA) was not a common technique in Ottawa. However, police continued to raise public awareness about this means where thieves use an amplification device to amplify the signal emanating from the key fob inside the house. That signal would then be relayed to the car, which unlocks the vehicle and allows it to be started. This type of theft would be deterred by using a radio frequency shield ( the faraday bag or box.) Although the Honda CRV was reported the most, there were still other types of vehicles being stolen. The thieves have been targeting models with a proximity key, the kind of key you use for a push-button start. Some of the models taken included newer models of the Dodge Durango, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Toyota Highlander, Lexus RX, and particular Ford F-Series trucks.
