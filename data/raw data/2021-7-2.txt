Columbus police say there have been 43 reported vehicle break-ins so far in 2021 in the German Village area. Of those, 22 happened in June alone. Car owners have reported that their car was hacked with no trace, and that the thieves used keyless attack technology disguised as a sensor to trick their cars into unlocking by thinking that the thief's sensor is the actual key fob.
