A group of academics from the University of Oxford and Armasuisse S+T disclosed details of a new attack technique against the popular Combined Charging System ( CCS) that could potentially disrupt the ability to charge electric vehicles at scale. Called Brokenwire, the method interferes with the control communications that transpire between the vehicle and charger to wirelessly abort the charging sessions from a distance of as far as 47m (151ft). The researchers explained that while it may only be an inconvenience for individuals, interrupting the charging process of critical vehicles, such as electric ambulances, could have life-threatening consequences. The researchers added that Brokenwire had immediate implications for many of the 12 million battery EVs estimated to be on the roads worldwide â€” and profound effects on the new wave of electrification for vehicle fleets, both for private enterprise and for crucial public services.
