A Polish gang of seven men stole millions of dollars worth of vehicles using relay amplifiers. Because the thieves didnâ€™t have a copy of the key fob, they weren't able to switch the vehicle off after they were stolen. The thieves had to drive the vehicles non-stop to their destination directly and had to leave the engine on even when refueling. A new keyfob was probably programmed at the destination. The gang stole Audi brand vehicles and operated during nighttime.
