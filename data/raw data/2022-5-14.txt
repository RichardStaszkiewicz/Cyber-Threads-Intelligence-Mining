Russian soldiers remotely disabled and stole 27 agricultural vehicles, worth $5 million USD, including combine harvesters and tractors from a John Deere dealership in Melitopol, Ukraine. The vehicles were equipped with GPS and geofencing ( a virtual perimeter) and their journey could be tracked. Anti-theft devices installed on the stolen vehicles, had been remotely activated to lock the stolen combine harvesters and prevent them from working.
