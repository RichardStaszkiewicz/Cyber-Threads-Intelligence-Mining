Researchers from Consumer Watchdog claimed that they hacked a Tesla vehicle using a device that infiltrated the cellular network. In a video, the researchers demonstrated that they could take over the infotainment screen in the Tesla to access the CAN-BUS and claimed that they could perform a wide-scale attack by amplifying the signal on the device. Viewers however, claimed that the hack seen in the video showed a Wi-Fi server that could intercept the network requests sent to Tesla and thus caused the red hacked message to be displayed on the screen.
