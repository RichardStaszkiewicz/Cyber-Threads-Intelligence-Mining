A hacker reprogrammed the cruise control button on his steering wheel to control a newly installed Android head unit through the vehicle's CAN-bus. Since the button was connected directly to an ECU, the hacker had to re-route the wires to communicate through the CAN bus. The Android head unit received the CAN commands sent from the steering wheel due to a keyboard emulator that converted the CAN Command to emulated keyboard signals and transferred the controls to the head unit.
