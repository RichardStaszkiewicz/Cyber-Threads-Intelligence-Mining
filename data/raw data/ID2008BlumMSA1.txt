Sporadic Partial Jamming Attack to disrupt the WAVE ( Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments ) Standard network. Simulations ran over 5 seconds each and the three jamming attacks. Sporadic Partial Jamming Attack: the attacker sporadically sends many messages, the size of a WAVE heart-beat message, consuming 75% of the total bandwidth. Attacks are affecting the reception of data pakets for jamming attacks. Substained Partial Jamming Attack to disrupt the WAVE ( Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments ) Standard network. Sustained Partial Jamming Attack: the malicious node sends one long message which consumes 75% of the total bandwidth of each service interval sent once per interval. Attacks are affecting the reception of data pakets for jamming attacks. Complete Jamming Attack to disrupt the WAVE ( Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments ) Standard network. Complete Jamming Attack: the malicious node constantly sends small messages the size of a WAVE heart-beat message, essentially consuming 100% of the total bandwidth ( minus the pauses for each AIFS interval in between transmissions ). Attacks are affecting the reception of data pakets for jamming attacks.
