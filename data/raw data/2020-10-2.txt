A researcher learned from two CVEs in Mercedes-Benz and BMW’s infotainment and exploited the same kind of vulnerability on Audi A7 2014 MMI’s infotainment system. The original vulnerabilities and the subsequent exploitations were due to improper handling of “format strings”, special characters used by programming languages to insert text into a string. Renaming the Bluetooth connection name to "%x%x%x%x%x", triggered memory handling issues, crashing the infotainment software. The incident demonstrated that publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in one automotive component may lead to exploitations on similar systems.
