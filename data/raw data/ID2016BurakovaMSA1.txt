Changing displayed values of different controls in the instrument cluster ( oil pressure, oil temperature, fuel level, ...) by reverse engineering the CAN data traffic and spoofing false messages. Spoofing of CAN messages. Change the display for: Oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, rpm, speed, tank level, battery charge and air pressure of the brake system. Controlling vehicle speed by spoofing false CAN messages. Spoofing of CAN messages. Overwriting the accelerator pedal using the Parameter Group Number ( PGN) Torque/Speed Control ( TSC1) message parameters, acceleration via the speed mode and increasing the target speed, preventing acceleration using torque control and reducing the target torque.
Deactivation of engine brake by spoofing CAN message with modified parameters. Spoofing of CAN messages. Deactivation of the motor brake via parameters of the TSC1 message.
