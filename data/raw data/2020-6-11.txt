A hacking group offered a database of BMW car owners for sale on the dark web. The group claimed that the database contained 384,319 records from a “call center” that managed customers of different car suppliers. A research company that obtained the database found that it contained almost 500,000 customer records from 2016 to 2018, including details of U.K owners of Mercedes, Seat, Honda, Hyundai, and other vehicle brands.
