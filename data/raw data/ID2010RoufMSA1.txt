Tracking of vehicles by triggering the TPMS sensors and capturing the responses. Two representative TPMS sensors were put close to a signal analyzer and USRP. Triggering the sensor by usage of a TPMS trigger tool. Capturing TPMS sensors transmissions. Signal analysis with MATLAB to understand modulation and coding schemes and also the message format. Information Gain of Signal Modulation and Coding Schemes. Monitoring TPMS data traffic under real driving conditions. Eavesdropping with live decoder 250 kHz. Tests on a Highway with two vehicles on different speeds and different angles. Tracking of vehicles possible. Triggering of tire pressure warning for the vehicle driver by spoofing of TPMS messages. Spoofing: Packet Generator sending packets.   Transmission of data packages to victim vehicle on 55 km/h and 110 km/h. Monitoring or spoofing of messages via remote. Triggering of warning lights and tyre pressure indication in the instrument cluster. Packet spoofing can drain battery. After two days of experiment, the ECU crashed and the TPMS service was no longer functional.
