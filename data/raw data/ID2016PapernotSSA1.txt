Attacking a black box deep neural network classifier by using adversarial examples. The target DNN is used as an oracle to create a synthesized data set. This data set is used to make an approximation of the model used by the oracle for learning. The approximation is used to generate adversarial samples to be misclassified from. Attacking target systems Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud. Substitute accuracy of up to 83%.  Transferability of adversarial samples of up to 76 %. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud with success rates of 96.19% and 88.94% respectively.
