According to Constable Douglas Belanger, of the Ottawa Police Service’s investigation , the volume of car thefts has been going up year over year for several years. It was added that the thefts became easy, because the computers in modern vehicles could be exploited. Thieves amplify the signal of a key FOB left inside a home, or they can plug directly into a car’s onboard diagnostics port and reprogram the vehicle, hacking it, basically, so that it responds to a thief’s key and not the owner’s.
