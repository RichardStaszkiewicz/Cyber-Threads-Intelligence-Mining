A hacker, recognized as Radoslav Gerganov, gained access to a Hyundai Tucson's head unit and was able to add and delete features from the system. Gerganov reverse engineered the head unitâ€™s firmware and revealed information that allowed him to root the head unit and gain access to it. Gerganov discovered that the same firmware used in Hyundai's head unit system is also used across a range of vehicle models manufactured from 2018 to 2021, meaning that many more head units of other vehicle models are vulnerable.
