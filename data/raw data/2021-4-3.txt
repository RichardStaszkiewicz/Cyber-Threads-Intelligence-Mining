Security researchers Ralf-Philipp Weinmann and Benedikt Schmotzle managed to hack the doors of a Tesla Model X with a drone carrying a Wi-Fi dongle. The researchers used the vulnerabilities to compromise parked cars and control the infotainment systems over Wi-Fi. To gain access, the researchers targeted a component called ConnMan. They were then able to manage network connections and run commands on the infotainment system of the Tesla. The researchers noted that it would have been possible for an attacker to unlock the doors and trunk, change seat positions, and enter both steering and acceleration mode but not manipulate drive control of the car.
