Hackers reverse-engineered the signals and circuits on an EV and a J1772 charger, the most common interface for managing EV charging in North America. They successfully disrupted vehicle charging with a spoofing device developed in a laboratory using low-cost hardware and software. The researchers performed three manipulations using a â€œman in the middle" (MITM) device that spoofed signals between the charger and vehicle. They were able to limit the vehicle's rate of charging, block the battery charging, and overcharged the vehicle.
