Cybersecurity researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design shared details about a family of bluetooth vulnerabilities that were found on devices from about a dozen system-on-a-chip ( SoC) vendors, which are also used in automotive infotainment systems, including Intel, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and Cypress, collectively referred to as BrakTooth. In their explanation, the researchers note that the vulnerabilities could be exploited for different types of attacks ranging from denial of service ( DoS) to arbitrary code execution in certain Internet of Things ( IoT) devices. According to the researchers, the affected bluetooth stacks can be found on all kinds of devices, from consumer electronics to industrial equipment. Their research revealed that BrakTooth affects over 1400 different product types including laptops, smartphones, audio equipment, home entertainment systems, automotive infotainment systems, and more.
