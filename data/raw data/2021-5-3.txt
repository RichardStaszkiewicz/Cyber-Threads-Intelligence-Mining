Signal jamming has seen a rise and has become a prevalent criminal trend across South Africa. Thieves were spotted on CCTV stealing vehicles using remote jamming in a manner that is both intricate and swiftly executed. The act involved individuals interfering or manipulating the vehicle's alarm system with remote signals - a standard garage remote is most commonly used - to gain access and steal the car ownerâ€™s personal belongings with relative ease.
