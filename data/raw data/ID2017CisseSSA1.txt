Fooling gradient-based algorithms for machine learning by generation of adversarial examples. Use of a loss function to generate adversarial examples with Houdini in order to mislead human pose recognition, semantic segmentation and speech recognition. Human Pose Estimation: Deception of algorithms to estimate human poses using targeted and untargeted attacks. Semantic segmentation: Network hallucinates a segmentation. Speech Recognition: By generating adversarial audio files, attack on ASR could be carried out.
