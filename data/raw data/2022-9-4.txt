Hyundai and Kia vehicles ( 2016-2021 models) have become favored targets of thieves because they lack keyless ignition hardware. Hyundai came up with a $170 security kit to deal with the issue. The kit can be installed by all 820 Hyundai dealerships in the US. Hyundai is also developing a software update to secure targeted vehicles. The software fix is expected to be available in the first half of 2023. The list of affected Hyundai models includes certain 2016-2021 models: Accent, Elantra, Elantra GT, Sonata, Veloster, Venue, Kona, Tucson, Santa Fe, Santa Fe Sport, Santa Fe XL and Palisade vehicles that use a steel key and do not have an engine immobilizer.
