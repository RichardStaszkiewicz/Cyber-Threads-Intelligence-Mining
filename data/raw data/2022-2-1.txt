Police were trying to track down a high-performance car worth tens of thousands of pounds snatched from outside its Wigan owner's home in the UK. The officers believed that the criminals used a relay signal booster to take the white Range Rover as the owner was still in possession of the keys, and no forced entry had been made into her home. The car was driven away from an address in Aspull in the middle of the night.
