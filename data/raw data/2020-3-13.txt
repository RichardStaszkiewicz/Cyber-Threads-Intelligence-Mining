Researchers discovered that the remote keyless system on Honda HR-V 2017 vehicles sends the same RF signal for each door-open request. Once an attacker obtains the frequency of the key fob and captures the “open door” transmission sent from the fob, they can re-use the “open door” signal in a replay attack as the RF signal sent by the fob doesn't vary. Other car models made by the OEM may have the same keyless system and therefore be prone to replay attacks.
