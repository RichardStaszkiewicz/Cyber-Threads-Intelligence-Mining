Merseyside, UK police urged the people of the North West England county to stay alert, as there were a number of keyless car thefts that had occured since December 2020. The stolen cars had keyless entry systems, which were manipulated by hackers that cloned the wireless signals from inside the victimsâ€™ homes, unlocked the vehicles, and started the engines. Most of the incidents occurred overnight between 1am and 6am, as well as between 4pm and 8pm. Among the stolen vehicle models were BMW, Volkswagen, and Ford cars.
