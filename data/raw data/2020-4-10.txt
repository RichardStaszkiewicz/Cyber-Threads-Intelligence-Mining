A Moldovan man was jailed for ten months after using a relay amplifying device to steal multiple luxury keyless cars in the UK, including a £37,000 BMW. In addition to the relay device, the police discovered the thief held a GPS jamming device, designed to block the GPS signals sent by the vehicle so it couldn’t be tracked once stolen.
