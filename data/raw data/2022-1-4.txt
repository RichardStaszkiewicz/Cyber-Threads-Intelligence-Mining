A hacker modified the firmware of an Electronic Power Steering ( EPS) ECU in a 2010 Volkswagen Golf Mk6. The hacker tried to extract the firmware over the CAN bus but failed. However, this resulted in some knowledge on how to brute-force the authentication and enter a password-protected diagnostics mode. Then, he described how he found a Volkswagen upgrade file and decrypted it. Finally, he loaded the binary code into Ghidra and made initial guesses at this unknown microcontrollerâ€™s architecture and memory map.
