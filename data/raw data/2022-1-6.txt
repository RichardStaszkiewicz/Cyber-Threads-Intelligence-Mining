A Hacker who didn’t like how Tesla Model 3 and Model Y have all information displayed on a center console instead of a more traditional dash cluster decided to connect together a dash cluster of his own, calling it the CANdash. The CANdash worked in a simple fashion, snooping the Tesla’s CAN bus for all the information relevant to the vehicle’s operation. It was capable of displaying everything from speed to the remaining range in the battery, while also allowing the user to keep an eye on things like coolant temperatures and whether the Tesla Autopilot system was available. The build relies on a CANserver, an ESP32-based device specifically built for hooking up to the CAN bus on Tesla vehicles and sharing the data externally. The data can then be piped wirelessly to an Android phone running CANdash to display all the desired information. By using an aftermarket dash clip or a 3D printed custom mount, the phone can then be placed behind the steering wheel to display data in the usual location.
