A group of cybersecurity researchers published a proof of concept for a vulnerability in Honda’s remote keyless system. The researchers posted videos demonstrating the use of a radio transceiver to lock, unlock, and remote start a 10th generation ( 2016-2021) Honda Civic. The videos served as proof of the capacity for hackers to exploit a vulnerability in Honda’s remote keyless system. The vulnerability was listed in the National Vulnerability Database ( NVD) as CVE-2022-27254. Honda’s remote keyless system sends the same radio frequency ( RF) code for each request, rather than employing a rolling code technique that changes the code after every request. As a result, Hondas and Acuras were open to replay Man-in-the-Middle ( MitM) attacks, where a nearby attacker intercepts the RF codes sent by the remote keyless system and later uses them to lock, unlock, or remote start the car.
