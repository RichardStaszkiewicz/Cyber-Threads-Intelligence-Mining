RailWorks Corporation, one of North Americaâ€™s leading railroad track and transit system providers, experienced a ransomware attack that led to the exposure of personally identifiable information of current and former employees, as well as that of independent contractors. The ransomware harvested the information before encrypting the files. The attackers might have gained access to names, addresses, driver license numbers, government-issued IDs, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and dates of hire or retirement.
