A Polish criminal network stole at least 34 cars worth $1.6 million using keyless technologies. The thieves used "technical equipment" to crack the vehicle's “KEYLESS GO” systems. The police were able to identify that at least 13 of the vehicles were dismantled into parts by the thieves, who manually removed identification numbers from the parts.
