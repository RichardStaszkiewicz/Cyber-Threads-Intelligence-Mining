A team of security researchers managed to gain administrative access to Reviver, the company behind California's new digital license plates, which launched in 2022. The access allowed them to track the physical GPS location of all Reviver customers and change a section of text at the bottom of the license plate designed for personalized messages. An attacker could remotely update, track, or delete anyone's REVIVER plate.
