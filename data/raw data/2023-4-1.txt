Vulnerabilities known as CVE-2023-26243, CVE-2023-26244, CVE-2023-26246, CVE-2023-26245 impacting Hyundai Gen5W_L in-vehicle infotainment system, were discovered by security researchers on 27.4.23. The decryption binary used to decrypt firmware files has an information leak that allows an attacker to read the AES key and initialization vector from memory. In addition, the AppUpgrade binary file, which is used during the firmware installation process, can be modified by an attacker to bypass the digital signature check. An attacker may be able to install a backdoor in the infotainment system to enable control over it when connected to the internet through Wi-Fi.
