Portscan Infotainment. Portscan of the Modular Infotainment Platform ( MIB). Reading of various files possible with extension for remote code execution via Internet on the MMX. This allows a control of the RCC. Brute force on Password key space. Telnet service is enabled. The key space of the passwords can be searched by brute force. This attack seems to work with all versions of the MIB IVI system. Password extraction via brute force possible. Accessing Radio and car control unit from Infotainment. RCC ( MIB radio and car control unit) can be accessed from MMX ( MIB main processor) via Ethernet ( Telnet). Access to RCC. Accessing chip for CAN communication. Renesas V850 can be accessed from RCC via a serial connection. Access to V850. Flashing malicious Update. Firmware Update on the MMX in order to be able to communicate with CAN. Software update function available. Firmware is signed with RSA, but not encrypted. If you get a firmware, it can be compromised and loaded on the Renesas V850. Remote code execution by sending malicious CAN messages. CAN messages can be sent to the CAN via a backdoor on the Renesas V850. Sending malicious CAN messages possible.
