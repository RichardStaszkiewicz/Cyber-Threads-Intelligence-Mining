A security researcher showed how the feature could be exploited to steal cars by manipulating the state where drivers who used their Tesla NFC key card to unlock their vehicles had to place the card on the center console to begin driving. The feature was introduced to the world In 2021 when Tesla issued an update that made its vehicles easier to start after being unlocked with their NFC key cards. The hacker noticed that not only did the feature allow the car to automatically start within 130 seconds of being unlocked with the NFC card, but it also put the car in a state to accept entirely new keys, with no authentication required and zero indication given by the in-car display. The hacker explained that authorization given in the 130-second interval was too general, not only for driving, and added that the timer was introduced by Tesla to make using the NFC card as a primary means of using the car more convenient.
