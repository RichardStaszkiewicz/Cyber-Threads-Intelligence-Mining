Researchers demonstrated their ability to exploit a Bluetooth code execution vulnerability to compromise the infotainment unit of Lexus NX300 and send diagnosis messages to the internal CAN network and related ECUs. In order to bypass the infotainmentâ€™s CAN message filtering capability, the researchers updated the firmware of one of the microcontrollers. The researchers also designed the code executed to automatically connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot, enabling them to send diagnostic commands that could trigger a car with physical motions through the Wi-FI. The vulnerable component in the infotainment was installed in Lexus (LC, LS, NX, RC, RC F), Toyota Camrys, and Toyota Siennas.
