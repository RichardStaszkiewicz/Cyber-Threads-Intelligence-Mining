Researchers at the Ubiquitous System Security Lab of Zhejiang University and the University of Michigan's Security and Privacy Research Group found a way to blind autonomous vehicles to obstacles using simple audio signals. The audio waves impact image stabilisers that are sensitive to acoustic vibrations. They pointed out that these sound waves can be used to intentionally tamper with object detection algorithms in a vehicle.
