Hackers launched a DDoS attack against German food delivery service Takeaway.com (Liefrando.de), demanding two bitcoins (about $11,000) to stop the flood of traffic. Liefrando delivers food from more than 15,000 restaurants in Germany, where people under COVID-19 restrictions depend on the service. The founder of the company posted about the attack via Twitter and included a note from the attackers indicating they planned to target other websites.
