A hacker claimed he had found flaws in a piece of third-party software used by several Tesla vehicle owners. David Colombo, a self-described information technology security specialist, claimed that he had found flaws in software that allowed him to unlock doors, open windows, start cars without keys, and disable their security systems. In addition, Colombo also claimed he could see if a driver was present in the car, turn on the vehicles’ stereo sound systems, and flash their headlights. He provided screenshots and other documentation of his research that identified the software maker and gave details of the vulnerabilities. Colombo said he could access more than 25 Tesla vehicles in at least 13 countries, and he took to Twitter when he couldn’t contact most of the owners directly. The hacker added that the problem involved an insecure way of storing sensitive information needed to link the cars to the program. In the wrong hands, the information could be stolen and repurposed by hackers to send malicious commands to the vehicles.
