Hackers recently compromised and stole a BMW 420i in Neutraubling, Germany. Police suspect the thieves entered and drove away with the vehicle by tampering with the keyless entry radio signal. It is believed that the black-hat hackers entered using a short-range radio system, prompting police to advise drivers with keyless systems in their vehicles to park in locked indoor garages, not on the street.
