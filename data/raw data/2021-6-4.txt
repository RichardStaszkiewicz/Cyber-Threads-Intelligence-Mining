Research led by Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab confirmed the ability to remotely shutdown ECUs in numerous vehicles. Tests involving proof-of-concept attacks were conducted on a 2009 Toyota Prius and a 2017 Ford Focus. The researchers launched disruption attacks against the two vehicles, using the SAM V71 and SPC58 evaluation boards, exploiting a specific feature implemented in today’s vehicles’ ECUs, allowing researchers to shutdown the 2017 Focus’ powertrain ECU and shutdown the 2009 Prius’ power steering ECU. Furthermore, the new class of vulnerabilities stem from some architectural choices that automakers have made in recent years, as most modern car functions are controlled by one or more ECUs or Electronic Control Units. The researchers found a way to exploit the peripheral clock gating feature implemented in the vehicles to reduce the amount of power the ECUs consume, which enables ECUs that aren’t actively being used to shutdown to conserve energy and uncovered a new attack strategy that could turn off this signal, eventually enabling them to craft raw data onto the vehicle’s network and shut down any ECU they had desired.
