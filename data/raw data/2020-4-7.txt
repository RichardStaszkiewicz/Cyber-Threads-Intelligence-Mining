CivicSmart, a vendor that sells parking meters capable of processing mobile payments, was hit last month with a form of ransomware known alternatively as Sodinokibi or REvil. The hackers intended to publish as much as 159 gigabytes of data including credit card numbers of the companyâ€™s customers, employee records and contracts with cities and parking-garage vendors. Messages posted to the hackers website suggest that CivicSmart paid an unspecified amount to take the files down from the hackers.
