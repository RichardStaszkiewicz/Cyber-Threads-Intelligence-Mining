Firmware Extraction. Connection to CAN via OBD. Firmware extraction of the media player. Firmware could be extracted. Reverse Engineering Firmware. Reverse Engineering of the media player firmware. Information Gain of Firmware Functionality. Memory Dump and identification of exploitable funtion pointers. Because of restriction attackers developed an in-circuit debugger that communicates over an unused serial port.  Dumping of memory possible.  Found functional pointers to overwrite. Identification of funtion pointers that could be overwritten. Firmware update on ECU by a custom ISO 9660 formatted CD and Execution of any code function by exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in the WMA parser. Creating a CD with malicious WMA audio file that exploits the WMA parser vulnerability and sends malicous CAN messages. Sending of any CAN message to the network.
