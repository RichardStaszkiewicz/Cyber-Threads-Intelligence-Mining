The Lexus LX, Toyota Motor Corp.’s luxury SUV, was targeted by thieves in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, as one out of five LXs in central Japan prefecture was stolen. Japanese police suspected several theft rings were operating in Aichi Prefecture. The thieves have been using a device which deactivated the car’s immobilizer, and the electronic anti-theft system, and launched relay attacks, which disrupted radio waves emitted by smart keys. In addition, a fairly new auto theft technique, dubbed CAN Invader in Japan, which exploits the Controller Area Network ( CAN bus) and is particularly difficult to prevent, was used to hack into the vehicles.
