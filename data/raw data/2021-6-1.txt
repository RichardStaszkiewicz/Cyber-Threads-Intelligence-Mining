Researchers from IoT security firm Vdoo disclosed a new set of critical vulnerabilities in a Realtek Wi-Fi module. Using these vulnerabilities could allow someone to hijack a deviceâ€™s wireless communications. The flaws found in the Realtek RTL8710C Wi-Fi, which is in use in the automotive industry, affect all embedded and IoT devices that use the component to connect to Wi-Fi networks. An attacker would be required to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the devices that use the RTL8710C module or know the network's pre-shared key. No known attacks exploiting the vulnerabilities are underway, according to the researchers, adding that firmware versions released after Jan.11, 2021 include mitigations that resolve the issue.
