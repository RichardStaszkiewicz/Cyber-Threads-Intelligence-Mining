A vulnerability in ARMv7 implementation of GNU C Library leaves smart vehicles open to attack through a vulnerable web server exposed through the vehicle’s Wi-Fi network. The vulnerability causes the program execution to continue with corrupted runtime state and allows exploitation after gaining access to the vehicle’s Wi-Fi network. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution on the vehicle.
