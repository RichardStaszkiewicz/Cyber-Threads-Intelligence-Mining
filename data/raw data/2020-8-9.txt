Thousands of Utah drivers unintentionally purchased cars with hacked odometers. Crooks tampered with analog as well as digital odometers, costing car buyers thousands of dollars and putting their safety at a high risk. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration estimates that 450,000 vehicles are sold each year with false odometer readings, costing American car buyers more than $1 billion annually.
