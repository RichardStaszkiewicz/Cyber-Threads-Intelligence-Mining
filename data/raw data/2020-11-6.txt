Researchers found a vulnerability in OBDeleven OBD-II which allowed hackers to unlock its premium features free of charge. The OBD-II is controlled via a bluetooth connected app which requires a paid subscription, allowing in-depth access to the ECU for advanced diagnostics and configurations. However, the connection to the ECU was done via the appâ€™s API, regardless of the payment status, and the vulnerability allowed users to use the app directly via the API without making a payment. In addition to the financial damage to the company, the vulnerability opened an entry point for attackers to access the ECU and inject messages.
