Tesla key fob contains vulnerability which reduces the complexity for brute forcing the encryption algorithm to finding two 40-bit keys. Analyzing key fob by challenge-response tests of its SPI communication interface. All valid commands and all valid values for the SPI CMD and LEN fields were uncovered. Additionally, four undocumented commands were found, which indicated that two independent DST40 implementations and two unknown cryptographic functions were implemented. Firmware extraction via key fob JTAG. Firmware was extracted. Firmware Analysis. It was discovered that only one of the four crypto ciphers was used in which the key length is only 40 bits. Protocol Analysis of PKES protocol and user-triggered key functions. Rolling code scheme was found which is vulnerable against jamming and eavesdropping. Brute Force on key space of the key fobs crypto ciphers. Key could be recovered.
