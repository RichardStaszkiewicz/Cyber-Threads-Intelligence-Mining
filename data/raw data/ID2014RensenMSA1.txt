Monitoring CAN messages. Capturing CAN data traffic while a diagnostic tester is doing the security access routine with a vehicles ECU. Obtainment of CAN messages. Monitoring Security Access. Sending different seeds to the diagnostic tester in order to capture the relating keys. Obtainment of Seed and Key Pairs. Breaking the security access by reverse engineering the data traffic and reverse engineering the security access algorithm with extracted seed and key pairs. Manual reverse engineering of the security access algorithm. Seeds and keys could be read. Security access algorithm could be reverse engineered for the airbag ECU.
