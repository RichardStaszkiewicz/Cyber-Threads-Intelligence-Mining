Researchers reverse engineered the Android head unit system of KIA Cee'd, exploited the vehicle's ability to install third-party applications, and instead installed an app containing malware. They exploited a previously discovered root privilege escalation vulnerability and created an exploit that could inject CAN frames to the M-bus and modify some of the IVI functionalities, such as manipulating the radio volume, switch the infotainment on and off, activate the reverse camera, and set a navigation address.
