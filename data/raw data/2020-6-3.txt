Researchers found security issues in a vehicle fine enforcement clamp that communicates via cellular network. They were able to use the SIM card to discover the barnacle's API and gain access to the entire environment by refreshing a request 10 times. Malicious hackers could have exploited this access to control all of the parking clamps and leak user data. The researchers also discovered they were able to unlock the barnacles for free, as the payment gateway didn't validate the credit card effectively, and also discovered that one of the S3 buckets was wide open and indexed by Google.
