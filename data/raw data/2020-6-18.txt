A hacker installed a custom infotainment system in his Toyota that enabled control over the ignition module and the vehicle's AC. The infotainment also allowed the changing of the honk sound and allowed honking through the infotainment instead of the steering wheel. The vehicle had to be immobilized with its key fob for the device to work.
