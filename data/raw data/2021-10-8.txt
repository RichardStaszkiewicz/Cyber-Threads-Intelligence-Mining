According to Tracker, a vehicle tracking company, Range Rover Sport was the most targeted vehicle in thefts in the UK as keyless car theft rose to an all time high. The Range Rover Vogue was the second most recovered followed by the Range Rover Autobiography, BMW X5, and Land Rover Discovery. Tracker added that of all the cars it recovered, 93% were stolen via relay attack station devices. That equates to a 26% rise compared to five years ago.
