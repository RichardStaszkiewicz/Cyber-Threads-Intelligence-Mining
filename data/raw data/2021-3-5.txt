Ford has urgently updated its security advice for all their owners in response to drivers fobs being jammed in a Tesco car park in Hertfordshire, UK. Ford said owners should follow the company’s solution if they thought the signal between their car fob and door was being tampered with as the walkaround could indicate where a divide was located and block its possible damage with immediate effect. The security advice can prevent keyless car thieves from gaining unauthorized access to owner’s cars.
