Advanced driver-assistance systems are susceptible to attacks by phantom objects - depthless objects projected or glued to the floor manipulating the ADASs and autopilot preception system to recognize the fake object as an actual obstacle or a road sign. This kind of objects can cause the Tesla Model X (HW 2.5) to brake suddenly or deviate to a different lane. These attacks can easily be applied remotly using a drone equipped with a portable projector or by hacking digital billboards that are located close to roads.
