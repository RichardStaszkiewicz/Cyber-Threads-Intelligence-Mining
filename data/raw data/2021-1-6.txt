The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked Tesla to recall some 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles that could suffer from failing display consoles. The failures of the media control units in these vehicles could sever the owner’s access to their vehicle’s backup camera, climate controls, and Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system. The problem at the heart of the defect that NHTSA wanted Tesla to fix involves worn-out flash memory chips used in the displays of 2012-2018 Model S sedans and 2016-2018 Model X SUVs. Tesla confirmed to NHTSA that all units with this chip will inevitably fail, according to the agency, and also provided a statistical model showing projected weekly repairs lasting from 2020 to 2028, with the most failures happening in 2022.
