According to Japanâ€™s Stylewagon Magazine, the ability to remotely unlock a vehicle without pressing an unlock button, with some car models automatically unlocking upon approaching them, makes it easier for thieves to conduct relay and code grabbing attacks. Thieves use the radio waves emitted from the remote control to unlock the car and start the engine very easily. The CAN Invader used for Toyota and Lexus cars has become a hot topic. Here, regardless of radio waves, the vehicle is stolen by interrupting the wiring of the car using some kind of equipment. As of early December 2021, there was no concrete countermeasure for CAN Invader. The smart key and the vehicle side have a transceiver that senses both radio waves, and each unit identifies a unique encrypted radio wave to carry out a relay attack. This means that hackers can unlock a vehicle very easily and generate a new smart key.
