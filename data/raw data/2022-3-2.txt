Researchers at Duke University demonstrated the first attack strategy that can fool industry-standard autonomous vehicle sensors into believing nearby objects are closer ( or further) than they appear without being detected. The researchers suggested that adding optical 3D capabilities or the ability to share data with nearby cars may be necessary to fully protect autonomous cars from attacks. The new attack strategy worked by shooting a laser gun into a car’s LIDAR sensor to add false data points to its perception. The research was conducted under the assumption that these data points were wildly out of place with what a car’s camera was seeing. In addition, previous research has shown that the system could recognize the attack. However, the new research from showed that 3D LIDAR data points carefully placed within a certain area of a camera’s 2D field of view can fool the system.
