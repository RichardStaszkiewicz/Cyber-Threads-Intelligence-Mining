Bypassing TPM protection by executing side channel attacks on TPM. Reset Attack: Isolation of the LRESET connection. Recording a trusted boot process that serves as a copy of a TPM measurement. The TPM module is now integrated into another hardware platform with a different operating system. The TPM recognizes this and will not reveal any information. Now the attacker sends a reset signal to the TPM, which triggers a reboot. During the reboot, the recorded measurement is infiltrated, which the TPM recognizes as valid and boots. This executes an untrusted configuration and all operations that are bound to the trusted platform can be executed. Execute an insecure configuration and thus control over all available operations of the trusted platform.
