The Boyd group, which runs Assured Automotive, Gerber Collision, Boyd Autobody, and additional roadside assistance and auto glass operations in the U.S and Canada was hit with a ransomware attack. While most of Boydâ€™s locations were able to continue to process and complete repairs at normal or near normal levels, this attack and the subsequent recovery period resulted in a temporary interruption of business and a loss of some sales.
