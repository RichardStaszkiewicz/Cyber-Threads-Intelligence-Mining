Police are warning car owners to be vigilant after another keyless theft in the Ardglena Grove area of Dungannon.  A white Hyundai Tucson parked in the driveway at a property in the area was stolen in mid-March.  The vehicle was locked, and the owner still had both keys.  In January, CCTV footage of two men attempting to steal a car in the Bush area of Dungannon was posted online by the vehicleâ€™s owner.  Their attempt was foiled, as the owner had stored the keys in a signal-blocking ( Faraday) pouch.
