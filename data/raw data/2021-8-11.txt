A research paper from Germany disclosed that NVIDIA has confirmed a hardware vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain privileged control of code execution for Tesla autopilot system. The attack involves a method of destabilizing hardware by introducing voltage surges, which enables someone to unlock a bootloader thatâ€™s usually disabled for consumers and intended for laboratory conditions. The attack is also valid for the Mercedes-Benz infotainment system, though with fewer potentially damaging consequences.
