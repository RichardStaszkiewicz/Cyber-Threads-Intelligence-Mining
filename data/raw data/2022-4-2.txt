According to a Marketplace investigation, cars stolen from Ontario and Quebec in Canada were openly advertised and sold in West African countries, including Nigeria and Ghana, which also found thieves are targeting vehicles with push-to-start ignitions. According to experts, OEMs prioritize convenience over security with push-to-start ignitions allowing thieves to quickly and easily steal vehicles to ship overseas, where demand for Canadian cars is high because of their reliability and the availability of parts, and the consequences for thieves are low. To steal the vehicles, thieves use a relay attack, in which a device is used to capture the signal of a car key fob inside a house and then amplified to open car doors. However, experts claimed that there was a cheaper and easier solution thieves have been turning to lock picks. Once inside the car, thieves typically plug a crucial programmer, available for under $1,000 online, into the car’s On-Board Diagnostics ( OBD) port, usually located under the steering wheel, where mechanics can plug in a diagnostic tool the car’s computer. Thieves can program a blank key fob to match the vehicle using this port. It can be done on nearly any vehicle with push-to-start ignition, and vehicles with physical keys require a separate tool to clone the key.
