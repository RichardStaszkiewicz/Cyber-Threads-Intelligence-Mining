noted O
a O
shift O

saw O
a O
sudden O
spike O
in O

more O

The O
OPS O
said O
vehicle O
thefts O
usually O
happened O
in O
one O
of O
two O
ways: O
The O
driver-side O
door O
was O
mechanically O
breached O
, O
at O
which O
point O
thieves O
accessed O
the O
vehicleâ€™s O
engine B_Com_M_m
control I_Com_M_m
module E_Com_M_m
( O
ECM S_Com_M_m
) O
port O
to O
reprogram S_AP_M_1
a O
new O
key S_Com_consists-of_1
. O

This O
was O
the O
most O
common O
type O
of O
vehicle B_Con
theft E_Con
, O
and O
it O
is O
not O
deterred O
by O
using O
a O
radio B_CoA
frequency I_CoA
shield E_CoA
( O
known O
as O
a O

. O

However O
, O
police O
continued O
to O
raise O
public O
awareness O
about O
this O
means O
where O
thieves O
use O
an O

the I_AP_M_m

emanating O
from O
the O
key B_Com_M_m
fob E_Com_M_m
inside O
the O
house O
. O

That O
signal O
would O
then O
be O
relayed S_AP_hasImpact_1
to O
the O
car O
, O
which O
unlocks B_Con_M_m
the I_Con_M_m
vehicle E_Con_M_m

allows O
it O

This O
type O

Although O
