S+T O
disclosed O
details O
of O
a O
new O
attack O
technique O
against O
the O
popular O
Combined B_Com_targets_1
Charging I_Com_targets_1
System E_Com_targets_1
( O

that O
could O
potentially O
disrupt S_Con_hasImpact_1
the O
ability O
to O
charge O
electric O
vehicles O
at O
scale O
. O

Called O
Brokenwire S_AP_M_m
, O
the O
method O
interferes B_Con_hasImpact_1
with I_Con_hasImpact_1
the I_Con_hasImpact_1
control I_Con_hasImpact_1
communications E_Con_hasImpact_1
that O
transpire O
between O
the O
vehicle O
and O
charger O
to O
wirelessly O
abort B_Con_hasImpact_1

sessions O
from O
a O
distance O

as O
47m O

The O
researchers O
explained O
that O
while O
it O
may O
only O
be O
an O
inconvenience O
for O
individuals O
, O
interrupting B_AP_hasImpact_1

added O
that O
Brokenwire S_AP
had O
immediate O
implications O

estimated O
to O
be O
