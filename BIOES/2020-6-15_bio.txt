A O
hacker O
demonstrated O
how O
Nissan B_Veh
Leaf E_Veh
owners O
could O
pair O
newly O
installed O
batteries O
while O
avoiding O
the O
'invalid O
battery O
' O
trouble O
code O
that O
reduces O
the O
vehicle's O
performance O
. O

In O
order O
to O
clear O
the O
trouble O
code O
, O
the O
vehicle O
control O
module O
ECU S_Com
had O
to O
acknowledge O
the O
new O
battery O
ID O
. O

The O
hacker O
demonstrated O
two O
methods O
to O
do O
it: O
The O
first O
method O
is O
to O
replace O
the O
LBC S_Com
(Lithium O
Battery I_Com
Control E_Com
) O
ECU O
into O
the O
new O
battery O
. O

The O
second O
method O
is O
initiating O
a O
MITM B_AP_M_1
attack E_AP_M_1
through O
the O
vehicle's O
CAN-bus. O
By O
spoofing S_AP_based-on_1
the O
ID O
of O
the O
previous O
battery O
on O
the O
messages O
sent O
by O
the O
newly O
installed O
one O
, O
the O
ID O
on O
the O
CAN-Bus S_AV_M_m
will O
match O
the O
one O
stored O
in O
the O
VCM B_Com_M_1
ECU E_Com_M_1
and O
will O
allow O
the O
vehicle O
to O
operate O
as O
if O
the O
new O
battery O
was O
programmed O
by O
the O
OEM O
. O
