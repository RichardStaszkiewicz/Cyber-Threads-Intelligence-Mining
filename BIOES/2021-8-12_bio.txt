According O
to O
Constable O
Douglas O
Belanger O
, O
of O
the O
Ottawa O
Police O
Service’s O
investigation O
, O
the O
volume O
of O
car B_Con_hasImpact_m
thefts E_Con_hasImpact_m
has O
been O
going O
up O
year O
over O
year O
for O
several O
years O
. O

It O
was O
added O
that O
the O
thefts O
became O
easy O
, O
because O
the O
computers S_Com
in O
modern O
vehicles O
could O
be O
exploited O
. O

Thieves O
amplify B_AP_hasImpact_1
the I_AP_hasImpact_1
signal E_AP_hasImpact_1
of O
a O
key B_Com
FOB E_Com
left O
inside O
a O
home O
, O
or O
they O
can O
plug O
directly O
into O
a O
car’s O
onboard B_Com
diagnostics I_Com
port E_Com
and O
reprogram B_AP_hasImpact_1
the I_AP_hasImpact_1
vehicle E_AP_hasImpact_1
, O
hacking O
it O
, O
basically O
, O
so O
that O
it O
responds O
to O
a O
thief’s O
key S_Com
and O
not O
the O
owner’s. O
