disclosed O
a O
new O
set O
of O
critical O
vulnerabilities O
in O
a O
Realtek S_Ide_related-to_1
Wi-Fi B_Com_related-to_1
module E_Com_related-to_1
. O

Using O
these O
vulnerabilities O
could O
allow O
someone O
to O
hijack S_AP
a O
deviceâ€™s O
wireless O
communications O
. O

The O
flaws O
found O
in O
the O
Realtek S_Ide_related-to_1

Wi-Fi, O
which O
is O

An O
attacker O
would O
be O
required O
