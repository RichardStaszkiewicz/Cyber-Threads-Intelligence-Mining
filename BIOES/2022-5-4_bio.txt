Ford S_Ide
developed O
a O

The O
keyless B_Com_targets_1

system E_Com_targets_1
, O
which O
added O
convenience O
to O
unlocking O

starting O
a O
vehicle O
since O
there’s O
no O

anymore O
, O
was O
vulnerable O
to O
attacks O
that O
led O
to O
many O

worldwide O
, O
as O
thieves O
had O
discovered O
that O
too O
soon O
stealing O
a O

became O
very O
easy O
. O

Ford S_Ide
found O
a O
solution O
and O
filed O
a O
patent O
to O
protect O
it O
. O

Called O
system O
for O
preventing O
vehicle O
key B_Com_targets_1
fob E_Com_targets_1
relay B_AP_M_m
attacks E_AP_M_m
, O
the O
patent O
describes O
a O
new O
authentication B_CoA_mitigates_1
system E_CoA_mitigates_1
that O
allows O
the O
car O
to O
know O
whether O
the O
original O
key S_Com
is O
near O
the O
vehicle O
or O
not O
. O

According O
to O
the O
patent O
filed O
on O
October O
29 O
, O
2020 O
, O
and O
published O
on O
May O
5 O
, O
2022 O
, O
the O
authentication B_CoA_mitigates_1
system E_CoA_mitigates_1
can O
obtain O
historical O
data O
, O
including O
the O
time O
and O
location O
of O
the O
key B_Com
fob E_Com
. O

Thus O
it O
can O
determine O
if O
the O
person O
trying O
to O
unlock O
the O
car O
is O
the O
owner O
or O
another O
person O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
since O
the O
car O
knows O
that O
the O
key S_Com
moved O
away O
when O
the O
owner O
left O
the O
vehicle O
, O
it O
will O
not O
respond O
to O
a O
signal O
that O
suddenly O
appears O
in O
its O
vicinity O
. O

There O
is O
still O
a O
place O
for O
improvement O
, O
as O
the O
spoofing B_Tool
devices E_Tool
can O
emulate O
the O
key S_Com
even O
in O
approaching O
the O
vehicle O
. O

Still O
, O
it’s O
progress O
in O
finding O
a O
solution O
to O
a O
significant O
attack O
method O
used O
by O
thieves O
, O
impacting O
the O
automotive O
industry O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
to O
avoid O
this O
kind O
of O
man-in-the-middle S_AP_mitigates_1
attack O
, O
it’s O
best O
to O
have O
a O
system O
that O
works O
at O
a O
very O
close O
distance O
. O

Newer O
vehicles O
use O
NFC S_CoA_mitigates_1
to O
open O
and O
start O
, O
which O
is O
far O
more O
secure O
than O
a O
radio B_Com_targets_1
signal E_Com_targets_1
that O
can O
be O
sniffed S_AP_targets_1
further O
away O
. O
