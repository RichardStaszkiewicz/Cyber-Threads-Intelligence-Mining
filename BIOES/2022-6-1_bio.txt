A O
security O
researcher O
showed O
how O
the O
feature O
could O
be O
exploited O
to O
steal B_Con
cars E_Con
by O
manipulating O
the O
state O
where O
drivers O
who O
used O
their O
Tesla S_Veh_consists-of_1
NFC B_Com_consists-of_1
key I_Com_consists-of_1
card E_Com_consists-of_1
to O
unlock O
their O
vehicles O
had O
to O
place O
the O
card O
on O
the O
center O
console O
to O
begin O
driving O
. O

The O
feature O
was O
introduced O
to O
the O
world O
In O
2021 O
when O
Tesla S_Ide_related-to_1
issued O
an O
update O
that O
made O
its O
vehicles O
easier O
to O
start O
after O
being O
unlocked O
with O
their O
NFC O
key O
cards O
. O

The O
hacker O
noticed O
that O
not O
only O
did O
the O
feature O
allow O
the O
car O
to O
automatically O
start O
within O
130 O
seconds O
of O
being O
unlocked O
with O
the O
NFC B_Com_M_1
card E_Com_M_1
, O
but O
it O
also O
put O
the O
car O
in O
a O
state O
to O
accept O
entirely O
new O
keys S_Com
, O
with B_Vul_hasVulnerability_1
no I_Vul_hasVulnerability_1
authentication I_Vul_hasVulnerability_1
required E_Vul_hasVulnerability_1
and O
zero O
indication O
given O
by O
the O
in-car B_Com
display E_Com
. O

The O
hacker O
explained O
that O
authorization O
given O
in O
the O
130-second O
interval O
was O
too O
general O
, O
not O
only O
for O
driving O
, O
and O
added O
that O
the O
timer O
was O
introduced O
by O
Tesla S_Veh_consists-of_1
to O
make O
using O
the O
NFC B_Com_consists-of_1
card E_Com_consists-of_1
as O
a O
primary O
means O
of O
using O
the O
car O
more O
convenient O
. O
