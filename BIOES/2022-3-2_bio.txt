Researchers O
at O
Duke O
University O
demonstrated O
the O
first O
attack O
strategy O
that O
can O
fool S_AP_M_m
industry-standard O
autonomous O
vehicle O
sensors S_Com_targets_1
into O
believing O
nearby O
objects O
are O
closer O
( O
or O
further O
) O
than O
they O
appear O
without O
being O
detected O
. O

The O
researchers O
suggested O
that O
adding B_CoA_mitigates_1
optical I_CoA_mitigates_1
3D I_CoA_mitigates_1
capabilities E_CoA_mitigates_1
or O
the O
ability O
to O
share B_CoA_mitigates_1
data I_CoA_mitigates_1
with I_CoA_mitigates_1
nearby I_CoA_mitigates_1
cars E_CoA_mitigates_1
may O
be O
necessary O
to O
fully O
protect O
autonomous O
cars O
from O
attacks O
. O

The O
new O
attack O
strategy O
worked O
by O
shooting B_Tool_uses_1
a I_Tool_uses_1
laser E_Tool_uses_1
gun O
into O
a O
car’s O
LIDAR B_Com_targets_1
sensor E_Com_targets_1
to O
add B_AP_M_1
false I_AP_M_1
data E_AP_M_1
points O
to O
its O
perception O
. O

The O
research O
was O
conducted O
under O
the O
assumption O
that O
these O
data O
points O
were O
wildly O
out O
of O
place O
with O
what O
a O
car’s O
camera S_Com
was O
seeing O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
previous O
research O
has O
shown O
that O
the O
system O
could O
recognize O
the O
attack O
. O

However O
, O
the O
new O
research O
from O
showed O
that O
3D B_Tool_uses_1
LIDAR I_Tool_uses_1
data I_Tool_uses_1
points E_Tool_uses_1
carefully O
placed O
within O
a O
certain O
area O
of O
a O
camera’s S_Com_targets_1
2D O
field O
of O
view O
can O
fool S_AP_M_1
the O
system O
. O
