Researchers O
discovered O
numerous O
security O
flaws O
in O
a O
range O
of O
smart B_Com
electric I_Com
vehicle I_Com
chargers E_Com
, O
including O
devices O
by O
Wallbox S_Com
and O
Project B_Com
EV E_Com
. O

The O
researchers O
were O
able O
to O
remotely B_Con
switch I_Con
the I_Con
chargers I_Con
on I_Con
and I_Con
off E_Con
, O
remove B_Con
the I_Con
owner’s I_Con
access E_Con
, O
and O
lock B_Con
or I_Con
unlock I_Con
the I_Con
charging I_Con
cable E_Con
. O

They O
explained O
that O
one O
could O
take B_Com
control I_Com
of I_Com
the I_Com
Wallbox I_Com
charger E_Com
, O
gain B_Con
full I_Con
access E_Con
, O
and O
remove B_Con
the I_Con
owner's I_Con
access E_Con
to O
the O
charger O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they O
claimed O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
stop O
the O
chargers O
from O
charging O
their O
own O
vehicles O
, O
and O
use O
them O
to O
charge B_Con
the I_Con
attacker’s I_Con
vehicle E_Con
for O
free O
charging O
. O

One O
of O
the O
researchers O
added O
that O
changing B_AP_M_1
the I_AP_M_1
programming E_AP_M_1
on O
the O
device O
would O
allow O
an O
attacker O
to O
permanently B_Con_hasImpact_1
disable I_Con_hasImpact_1
the I_Con_hasImpact_1
charger E_Con_hasImpact_1
or O
use O
it O
to O
attack B_Con_hasImpact_1
other I_Con_hasImpact_1
chargers E_Con_hasImpact_1
or O
servers O
, O
and O
that O
bad O
actors O
could O
also O
infiltrate B_Con
a I_Con
home I_Con
network E_Con
in O
cases O
where O
the O
chargers O
were O
connected O
by O
Wi-Fi. O
